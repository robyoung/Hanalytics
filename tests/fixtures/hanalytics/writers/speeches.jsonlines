That is as it should be.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/2\">The IPCC will not become complacent, nor will this Government let it. Having made those points to the right hon. Member for Tottenham, I do not want him to think that I am dismissing what he has said. I hope he knows that I am not.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/3\">Following four years\u2019 operational experience, the IPCC conducted a review of the police complaints system, the aims of which were to check how well the system was delivering against the original aspirations and to ensure that it continued to improve. The review found that some of the statutory provisions for the handling of complaints were unnecessarily bureaucratic or no longer necessary. Through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which we have just passed, the</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/4\">Government are introducing reforms that will put an emphasis on police accountability and make the police complaints system more effective and efficient. That will mean giving police forces additional discretion to deal with low-level complaints, which will free up the IPCC to deal with the most serious and high-profile complaints. It is important to distinguish between matters of public concern about performance issues, in which case what often matters is that there is strong police accountability and responsiveness, and those on which there are serious complaints about a breakdown that needs investigating by the commission.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/5\">We are giving the IPCC new powers to recommend and direct that unsatisfactory performance proceedings be brought against an officer when a complaint reveals that their performance is unsatisfactory. We are also giving the commission more flexibility in how it carries out its administrative functions, so that it has the freedom to direct more resources to carrying out its investigations. Those changes and others will improve the handling of police complaints by removing bureaucratic processes from the system, but it is important to realise that we are not stopping there.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/6\">In July, on the back of the revelations about phone hacking, we announced to Parliament that we would give further consideration to whether the IPCC needed additional powers, including the power to question civilian witnesses during the course of its investigations, and whether it should be given greater powers to investigate institutional failings in police forces. As the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, the IPCC is also in the early stages of a review of its powers, resources and approach in relation to investigations arising from deaths following police contact. That is obviously a very serious issue, and I know the IPCC has been in touch with him, and will keep in touch, about that piece of work. I will take the closest interest in it as well. In addition, we are setting up police and crime commissioners, to be elected a year from today, to hold the police to account.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/7\">I also want to respond to the points made about the IPPC\u2019s chairmanship. I am aware of concerns that we do not have a permanent chairman at the moment. We are taking particular care over the position, precisely because it is crucial to ensure the success of the IPCC. A new chair should be in place early in the new year, but until then Len Jackson, a highly effective individual in whom the Government have complete confidence, has agreed to remain interim chair. We are determined to secure the right appointment to the organisation, because we invest considerable importance in its independence and integrity. It has new challenges to meet and old challenges that still have to be met. I accept the right hon. Gentleman\u2019s concern about it, and I want to assure him and the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee that the Government will continue to ensure that the IPCC does the job that it was set up to do\u2014</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.2/8\" class=\"italic\">House adjourned without Question put (<phrase class=\"standing-order\" code=\"9(7)\">Standing Order No. 9(7)</phrase>).</p>\n"], "speakername": "Nick Herbert", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047", "column": "", "time": "019:21:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.819.2", "house": "commons"}

Member for Tottenham about the proportion of IPCC investigators who come from a police background. He said that about 30% of investigators and about 10% of the IPCC\u2019s staff overall come from a police background. Let us put it the other way around: the vast majority of investigators\u201470% of them\u2014do not come from a police background. The contribution of those from a law enforcement background is vital in ensuring that the IPCC conducts competent and robust investigations. The idea that the IPCC is an organisation that consists of police officers investigating other police officers is a grotesque caricature, because of its make-up, the way it operates, and the way Parliament established it.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.819.0/3\">The right hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of the IPCC\u2019s budget. Its budget is some \u00a335 million a year and it employs approximately 400 staff. That does not make it a small organisation by any standards. Shortly before I was elected to the House in March 2005, the IPCC had a total of 72 investigators, deputy senior investigators and senior investigators. In March this year, it had 121 such investigators. Its role has broadened in some respects, but it is not an organisation that has been starved of public funds. Of course the IPCC needs to manage with a diminishing budget during the current period, because all policing organisations have to make savings. Nevertheless, in 2010-11 it started 164 investigations and completed 154, which is more than 50% more than in the previous year. I therefore do not believe that allegations about resourcing can be made about this organisation.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Nick Herbert", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047", "column": "", "time": "019:21:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.819.0", "house": "commons"}

Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase> on securing this debate. I appreciate his long-standing interest in this topic and</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.2/2\">his immediate concerns about the ongoing investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the events surrounding the shooting of Mark Duggan in his constituency on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-08-04\">4 August</phrase>. The whole House will recognise the passion with which he speaks on these issues and, I believe, will share his overriding concern, which is to secure community confidence in policing. That confidence is essential to ensure policing by consent, which we so prize in this country.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.2/3\">I join the right hon. Gentleman in praising the police for the work that they do, including that to secure order on our streets in the summer. That work is often difficult and dangerous. It is nevertheless imperative that when there are instances where police action goes wrong and there is culpability, there must be a robust system to ensure that that confidence in policing is maintained. That is as much in the interests of the police themselves as of those of us who guard the public interest to ensure that it happens.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.2/4\">I should like to address two key issues that the right hon. Gentleman raised. First, I will set out the background to the IPCC, including how it is set up and the way it operates, and deal with some of the issues relating to budgets and staffing. Secondly, I want to turn to the future and set out the issues confronting the IPCC in the context of the Government\u2019s overall programme for reform of the system to ensure that we can maintain confidence in the police complaints system and that it plays a key role in the new policing landscape.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.2/5\">The police are a monopoly public service and their officers exercise coercive powers over citizens. They are expected to, and must, uphold the highest standards of behaviour and provide a policing service that enjoys the confidence of the public. The police complaints system is an important safeguard in holding the police to account. The complaints system should focus on allowing people who are dissatisfied with the provision of a policing service to make a complaint, and that complaint to be responded to appropriately.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.2/6\">There needs to be public confidence in the integrity and independence of the complaints system. It was the importance of that independence that gave rise, for the reasons the right hon. Gentleman described, to the establishment of the IPCC, in preference to the bodies that preceded it, in 2004 under the Police Reform Act 2002. It is worth reiterating that the IPCC is independent by law and makes its decisions independently of the police, Government, complainants and interest groups. This means that all complaints must be dealt with in accordance with legislation and the guidance issued by the IPCC and agreed by the Home Secretary. All complainants who have their complaints dealt with by the police in the first instance have a right of appeal to the IPCC. It independently investigates the most serious incidents and complaints. It regularly reports publicly on the outcome of investigations and it makes local and national recommendations as appropriate to ensure that the same things do not go wrong again. Its reports have to stand up to the scrutiny of inquests and courts.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.2/7\">The Government no more direct the IPCC than we direct police forces.

In fact, a sub-set of complaints is in effect being handled by the police. Again, we will need reassurances about whether the budget is appropriate for the sort of organisation that has to be armed to do this job independently and effectively. This is why there is a trust deficit in what the organisation does, and I hope that the Minister will respond to it.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.1/2\">The Minister will, of course, need to start by reviewing the many deaths that take place following police actions. Since 1999, according to the Library, 322 people have died in or following police custody, yet not one police officer has been jailed for any of those incidents. These are shocking figures. I ask the Minister to reflect on the sheer extent of those figures, whether he is content, and whether there should not be some independent review into that aspect of its work.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.817.1/3\">I hope that the Minister will commit to an inquiry into the disgraceful revelations regarding the handing over of the wrong body to the family of Christopher Alder, who died in police custody in April 1998. Mr Alder was a paratrooper who fought for his country, yet he was left to choke to death, handcuffed on the floor of a police station in Hull. The fact that his family found out just two weeks ago that the body they buried was not in fact his, and that he is in a mortuary over a decade later, is a disgrace and of tremendous concern in a civilised country.

I hope that the Duggan inquiry will go some way towards doing that, but the IPCC, given the way in which it handled those initial days, has made things hard and has not lived up to those expectations. What assurances can the Minister give the people of Tottenham that the Duggan inquiry will be thorough and independent? A good start would be to address the shocking statistic that 30% of IPCC investigators are former police officers, and far fewer are from an ethnic minority background.

In the Roger Sylvester case, as in others, power is often handed to the Crown Prosecution Service, which then does not prosecute. There is an inquest that brings in an unlawful killing verdict, and the families feel very let down indeed. The initial inquiry should have that prosecution power in the first place.

Mark Duggan\u2019s family were forced to learn of the death of their son and father from watching television. That is beyond unacceptable. Why did nobody from the IPCC contact the family on the day of his death, when it had opened its investigation? Despite warnings from people throughout the community, the IPCC failed to communicate with the family until two days after the shooting, and even then it was unable to communicate anything of substance to them. That is not good enough.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.814.1/5\">Despite employing 15 media officers, the IPCC failed to make an appearance in the media to reassure a sceptical public\u2014certainly in my community\u2014that it would investigate Mark Duggan\u2019s death thoroughly, impartially and independently. Its inability to fulfil that responsibility is difficult to explain. There was no direct communication by the IPCC to the affected communities in Tottenham in the hours and days after Mark Duggan\u2019s death. Would it have been too difficult to hand-deliver a letter to residents of the affected areas, reassuring them of the investigation, explaining the known facts and appealing for calm and co-operation?

It was put out that there had been an exchange of fire in the incident that led to Mark Duggan\u2019s death, but that turned out not to be true. Why did that happen?

It is right in such a debate to begin by thanking all local officers in Tottenham for the work that they do day in, day out. The vast majority of them serve us very well indeed. Some of those brave men and women serve their own community, and it is clear that they put others ahead of their own needs. All of them put their lives on the line to keep Tottenham safe, and I thank them for that.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/2\">However, for all the bravery of those officers, things very occasionally go wrong, and when they do go wrong, individual officers must be held to account for their decisions and actions. There is no way of escaping Tottenham\u2019s recent history: there is a history of people in Tottenham dying during or following police contact. I wish to God that this were not true, but anyone who has lived in Tottenham knows just how those deaths have strained the relationship between some of our residents and the police. With the death of Cynthia Jarrett in 1985, Roger Sylvester in 1999, and Mark Duggan this August, Tottenham\u2019s history has been punctuated and measured by these tragic events.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/3\">Of course, deaths in police custody or following police contact are not only a Tottenham issue, as, for example, the unexplained death of Christopher Alder in Hull more than a decade ago shows us, and they are not just an issue for the black community. Recent years have seen the deaths of Ian Tomlinson and Jean Charles de Menezes due to police actions. But in Tottenham we do seem to bear our share of these tragic events.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/4\">It takes years\u2014decades\u2014of effort to build community relations and to foster a two-way sense of trust between residents and the people who should be their police. Despite a lot of good work, it is the list of deaths that everyone remembers. It is not just the fact that a person has died following contact with the police that is important; how the death is investigated and who carries out the investigation are just as important. That is what I want to discuss this evening.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/5\">Before describing how I think the IPCC can be improved, it is important to recognise that the journey to the creation of an independent complaints authority has not been short or without controversy and resistance, because we have come a long way indeed. In 1985 Lord Scarman produced his groundbreaking report on the Brixton riots four years previously. He was deeply concerned about the total breakdown of trust between the police and some of the communities they were supposed to serve. His report called for an independent body to be set up to investigate police complaints as a means of restoring trust.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/6\">Unforgivably, it would be another 19 years before the IPCC opened for business. Instead of the Government agreeing to what was so obviously needed, deckchairs were duly rearranged and the old Police Complaints</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/7\">Authority was set up to replace the Police Complaints Board, but it proved just as hapless. Changing a word in the title proved easier than changing the way of working, because in those days it did not matter whether it was the Police Complaints Authority or the Police Complaints Board that conducted the investigation. They were not investigations for the victim, their family or the concerned community; they were investigations by the police and for the police.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/8\">The opening of the Stephen Lawrence murder trial yesterday again brings the failures of the Police Complaints Authority into sharp public view. The Macpherson report on Stephen\u2019s death highlighted these failures perfectly. It noted that the authority\u2019s report on the Metropolitan police\u2019s handling of the death was known as the Kent report, principally because the Kent police handled the inquiry into the Metropolitan police. The Kent report began making excuses for the Metropolitan police in its preface:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/9\">\u201cThe depth of detailed scrutiny applied in the complaints investigation could have found fault in most police criminal investigations. The reader of this report should bear in mind that the benefit of hindsight and the luxury of having time to assess all of the information that was available to the MPS is bound to reveal errors, omissions and flawed judgement.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/10\">The Macpherson report highlighted the shocking extent to which the Police Complaints Authority examined whether racism impacted on the Met\u2019s investigation, stating:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/11\">\u2018Many officers were asked directly whether racism had an impact upon their activities in the case. Predictably they replied in strong terms denying such impact. The result was the finding by Kent that: \u201cKent Police have found no evidence to support the allegation of racist conduct by any MPS officer involved in the investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence.\u201d\u2019</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/12\">Scarman\u2019s warning in 1985 about the lack of independent oversight of the police had become, 12 years later, the whitewash of the Kent police\u2019s so-called investigation of racism in the Met. Like the Scarman report, the Macpherson report called for an independent body to investigate police complaints.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.813.2/13\">Thankfully, one Home Affairs Committee report later, the Government listened that time and the IPCC was set up in 2004. Make no mistake: the IPCC is certainly an improvement on what went before, as the police are not investigating themselves. We are pleased about that, but not very pleased, and certainly not content. The death of Mark Duggan tells us why we should not be content with what we have, because it is not yet good enough.</p>\n"], "speakername": "David Lammy", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40615", "column": "", "time": "019:02:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.813.2", "house": "commons"}

Today, average pump prices are approximately 6p per litre lower than they would have been if we had continued with the previous Government\u2019s planned escalator, which the Opposition are so keen to airbrush out of history. That means that a typical Ford Focus driver would have been \u00a356 better off in 2011-12, and an average haulier \u00a31,700 in 2011-12. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Opposition Members are chuntering and trying to suggest that motorists would be better off under their plans for an escalator and a VAT rate of 17.5%.

Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase> was planning to increase VAT.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.809.7/2\">The Opposition cannot say where \u00a312 billion of extra expenditure would come from, and it is simply not true that motorists would at present be better off under the previous Government\u2019s plans. When comparing the changes that we announced in the Budget with the previous Government\u2019s fuel duty and VAT plans, pump prices are approximately 3p a litre lower. By the end of the Parliament, average pump prices will be 3.5p a litre lower. Cutting fuel duty and scrapping their escalator will more than offset the impact of the increase in VAT.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.809.7/3\">I shall quickly address the issue of whether oil price falls summer have been passed on at the pump, which is a matter of concern to hon. Members who have participated in the debate and to many of our constituents. For motorists to realise the benefits, as we all wish them to do, retailers need to pass those on at the forecourt.

After such a good debate, I hope that I speak for Members from all parts of the House in saying that we all want motorists to benefit as much as possible from falls in oil prices. A number of complexities mean that pricing is not the same at every petrol station in every part of the country, but overall prices today are lower than they were at the beginning of the summer, just as they were lower at 6 pm on Budget day after we cut prices by 1p. They are 6p a litre lower because of the actions taken by this Government.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.809.7/5\">Furthermore, I regret to say that the motion is wrong about fuel duty receipts, which have not fallen by \u00a31 billion since 2008.

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40671\" name=\"Robin Walker\">the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker)</phrase>: the price gap in the UK between petrol and diesel, which is up to 8p a litre. The duty is, of course, the</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.801.2/3\">same; it is the higher cost of production that leads to a higher price. That is the reverse of the situation 10, 15 or 20 years ago.

There is no reason for having the same rate of tax on fuel, and having a lower rate for diesel would greatly assist business.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.801.2/4\">The differential between the price of diesel in the UK in comparison with mainland Europe is also important, as my hon.

Between January 2009 and January 2011, it increased by \u00a31,000 a month before VAT\u2014\u00a312,000 a year.

The cost of energy is a significant one, and the cost of food is going through the roof. Inflation is going up, wages are stagnant and the people in our constituencies are struggling desperately. I welcome the fact that Conservative Back Benchers are finally showing an understanding of the principle of the Government forgoing revenue in order to deliver economic growth, reducing the deficit through the higher tax revenues that result from people having more money in their pockets. It was exactly that principle that persuaded me to vote in favour of shelving the increase, when Conservative Members were not doing so.

Government Members are instinctive tax cutters, which is why we have set out plans to reduce corporation tax to the lowest rate in the G7 by the end of this Parliament. That is where our instincts lie, and my hon. Friend the Minister knows that.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.792.4/3\">In contrast to some of the other speakers today, I want to consider the future in relation to fuel prices and talk about how some of the new technologies will be able to help save our constituents money. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-05-10\">10 May</phrase> I held a debate in Westminster Hall, in response to which the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362\" name=\"Norman Baker\">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, told hon. Members that people who buy a Nissan Leaf would have an average reduction in their motoring costs of around \u00a31,000 per year, and that there would be a payback on the total costs within seven years. He also sent me further information to show that the seven-year fuel costs of a Ford Focus are \u00a36,827. For a Toyota Prius that figure is \u00a34,034, and for a Nissan Leaf coming on sale next year, it is just \u00a3517. Some 48 other makes of electric vehicle will be available soon\u2014for example, the Vauxhall Ampera and others. I am delighted that in my constituency, charging points for electric cars will be installed at Ashton square by the Grove theatre car park in Dunstable, and at the West street and Hockliffe street car parks in Leighton Buzzard.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.792.4/4\">We have rightly heard much about the problems faced by small businesses. We need to consider the use of biomethane for trucks and hydrogen fuel cell technology for buses and heavy vehicles. At Nagoya airport in Japan all the buses are powered by hydrogen fuel cells. We need to ensure that we develop a hydrogen refuelling network, as we are doing for electric vehicles. Our constituents will then be able to enjoy cheaper fuel.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.792.4/5\">We also need to look at what is happening internationally. In Israel and Denmark the Better Place company is engaged across the whole economy. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-11-01\">1 November</phrase> Mr van Erck of that company told a meeting of the Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport Forum, at which some hon. Members were also present, that within three years the best-selling vehicle would be electric. Not only can we have cheaper motoring for our constituents, but the UK is also on track for a sizeable share of what HSBC estimates to be a $677 billion market by 2020. That was mentioned by Michael Hurwitz, a director of the Government\u2019s Office for Low Emission Vehicles on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-11-01\">1 November</phrase>. Such a plan would stimulate the economy and create British jobs for British workers, as well as lower prices for our constituents.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.792.4/6\">The UK is in a race to design, manufacture and power cheaper low-carbon vehicles. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to lead in this industry as we lead in Formula 1, with eight of the Formula 1 teams based in \u201cmotorsport valley\" in the United Kingdom. Such a challenge will be good for our constituents\u2019 pockets and good for the economy. I recommend to the Government that we power forward in this area, for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Andrew Selous", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40557", "column": "", "time": "017:53:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.792.4", "house": "commons"}

I will start with two observations. First, I am glad that there has been little evidence today in the House of the green zealotry that drove the increase in fuel prices\u2014a point we must not forget, because it was argued that that was a way of weaning the population off fossil fuels. Secondly, although Members have talked about the role of petrol and oil companies, let us not forget that 60% of the cost of fuel is accounted for by Government action. Therefore, this is the appropriate place to debate what can be done about it.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.790.0/2\">The Government\u2019s record on this differs from what they said in opposition. They had many fine ideas in opposition. Indeed, in \u201cA Fair Fuel Stabiliser\u201d they indicated that any reform should help families when the cost of living is rising and reduce the inflationary impact on the economy\u2014but what has the record been since they came into power? In Northern Ireland, fuel bills for families have increased by an average of \u00a3254 a year for those using diesel and \u00a3284 a year for those using petrol. The Government promised in opposition to do something for families when the cost of living was rising, but their actions have been different.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.790.0/3\">They made clear in opposition what they thought about an increase in VAT. Indeed, in an intervention in this House in 2008, a Conservative Member asked the then shadow Chancellor:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.790.0/4\">\u201cDoes my hon. Friend not agree that Labour\u2019s plans to increase VAT to\u2026 perhaps even 19.5 per cent\u2026. after the next election will hit hard-working families hardest?

Friend rightly points out, that is a vital issue for our local communities.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.789.6/2\">The road transport angle is vital to my constituency, where many jobs depend on the industry, as it is a major road and network hub for UK distribution. Many transport and haulage companies are suffering greatly. As we have heard, most heavy goods vehicles do about 8 miles to the gallon, so the planned 3p increase in January 2012 will add about \u00a315 a week to the cost of running a vehicle, according to figures I have received from the Freight Transport Association.

They will either</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.789.6/3\">absorb the cost or pass it on to their customers. With such low operating margins in the transport sector these days, I suspect that it is inevitable that the increase will be passed on, thus adding further inflation to the supply chain.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.789.6/4\">Furthermore, an increase would also widen the gap between UK and continental fuel prices and increase the number of foreign trucks operating in the UK. We should think carefully about that, because foreign trucks pay no UK fuel duty, no UK road fund licence and no UK employment taxes. That will increase their ability to undercut UK hauliers, potentially put UK jobs at risk and exacerbate the loss of tax take that hon. Members have mentioned this evening. Smaller haulage companies tell me that fuel prices are crippling their cash flow, as they have to pay at the pump or on very short seven-day credit terms, whereas their customers want 30, 60 or 90-day credit terms.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.789.6/5\">I would like to say more on this important matter and talk about the general motorist and car driver, but unfortunately I am running short of time.

The main services in villages have closed down, so people have to travel to the main towns to shop, to go to the doctors or to go to work. They rely on their car to get about or, in the case of some older people, on the kindness of a friend to give them a lift. Yet again, if people cannot run their car because of costs, that has a negative effect on all aspects of their life. I am concerned about the impact on both the young and older people in rural communities, as they may become ever more isolated, making them more vulnerable. How do pensioners on a fixed income that has been stretched to the limit find the extra money to cope with further fuel increases?</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.787.6/3\">Some people argue that a reduction in fuel duty and thus fuel prices would mean an increase in the number of journeys and carbon emissions. I absolutely understand that argument, which reflects the fact that there is a difficult balance between our desire to tackle climate change and enabling people to go about their daily business, go to work, support their family, and run their company. Simply pricing people out of their car is not a real solution, especially in areas such as West Lancashire, where there is no real alternative in place.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.787.6/4\">It strikes me that with a flatlining economy, rising unemployment and businesses unwilling to invest because of the current uncertainty, now is exactly the time for flexibility and common sense.

They want help to ease that burden, and it is probably the least they are owed, after broken promises to introduce a fuel duty stabiliser, a failure to scrap the planned fuel duty increase and a decision to increase VAT. It is time for social justice and fairness. It is time for the Government to listen and to act.

That will be the main thrust of what I say. I was in business in Cornwall; indeed, on many occasions, I drove a lorry that took our excellent Cornish strawberries to Birmingham. The reality is that Cornwall is 300 miles away from London, and 260 miles away from Birmingham. We have to drive the best part of 100 miles just to get to the seat of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614\" name=\"Sarah Wollaston\">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase>. Let us look at how that translates into tax. A typical 16-tonne lorry doing a round trip to London would incur, in total, tax of \u00a3220, just on that one trip. Let us compare that with a lorry driving from Birmingham to London: the tax taken for that would be only \u00a380. A similar operation in Cornwall has to pay three times more tax. That is unfair, and it is felt acutely by businesses in the primary sector, particularly in areas such as fishing and farming, in which Cornwall has a comparative advantage.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.786.1/2\">If we are serious about developing a regional policy, we have to help the most peripheral regions to develop industries and jobs in the sectors in which they have a comparative advantage. The irony is that places such as Cornwall have EU grants to help develop businesses in the areas where we have strengths, which include food processing, farming, and green energy. The regional growth fund has a similar purpose. We are undermining those efforts by having a regressive tax through high fuel duties. The impact is to compound the single most important disadvantage that the regions have, which is their distance from the market. As I say, that is particularly noticeable in Cornwall. Our climate gives us a comparative advantage; we grow potatoes early, and can grow cauliflowers in winter\u2014bulky commodities that cost a lot to transport. Of course, with our marine resources, we have fishing, too.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.786.1/3\">I want to finish with a suggestion on how we might go forward. Alongside the rural rebate, which is due to be piloted, we should consider, perhaps as a strand of regional policy, some kind of rebate for businesses in peripheral regions such as Cornwall. It should not be beyond the wit of man to devise such a scheme. To be eligible, a business would have to be located in a county such as Cornwall. The rebate would be available only on fuel supplies delivered to an address in the area. As for how we would give the rebate, we have heard that most businesses that run a transport fleet would be VAT-registered, so it would be possible to have some kind of fuel duty rebate that runs alongside the VAT return. I know that none of these things is easy; it would take some work to develop the detail of such a policy, but it would be an interesting idea to look at. It could be a very powerful regional policy.

We have proposed the introduction of a fair fuel duty regulator that would prevent unexpected spikes affecting people at the pump through increased VAT which is then pocketed by the Treasury. We suggested that an estimate be made of the fuel price over the coming six months, showing the amount of revenue that the Government would expect to receive, and that a cap be imposed if the price reaches an upper limit and VAT and fuel duty be frozen until the end of that period. The Government would, of course, receive their predicted amount, rather than a windfall from consumers who are already squeezed by the price hikes and unable to spend their income elsewhere.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.781.2/3\">Unfortunately, the then Labour Government in London stubbornly ignored the problems of rising fuel prices, and the motions in 2005 and 2008 addressing the issue were defeated. The Conservatives abstained in the vote on the 2008 Finance Bill, but decided only a few weeks later\u2014in July 2008\u2014that they would support a fuel duty stabiliser, a move that we welcomed at the time, believing that if they came to office they would introduce a mechanism similar to that we had been advocating. Sadly, when the matter was put to the vote in February this year, the voting pattern was reversed: the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats voted down our motion, while the Labour party abstained. This ever-changing position on a fuel duty stabiliser shows the political expediency of many politicians.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.781.2/4\">In March 2011 the UK Government cut fuel tax by 1p per litre and delayed some future rises, but the VAT increases have had a significant impact on prices. We voted against that move in summer 2010 and recommended a cut in June this year. The stabiliser model that we suggested is not the one that has been introduced by the UK Government, and it is clear that the problem has not yet been solved. Two further duty rises are scheduled for 2012, which could have dire consequences for business and motorists alike, especially given the ongoing economic difficulties, which are not likely to be solved in the near future.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.781.2/5\">We therefore need an effective and fair fuel duty stabiliser, and we must also look at pricing in rural areas.

One concern I particularly wanted to raise is the fact that diesel in this country is so much more expensive than anywhere else in Europe. I am told that this is not simply a matter of taxation as the rates of fuel duty are set equally for unleaded petrol and for diesel, but of refining capacity, which <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40681\" name=\"Albert Owen\">the hon. Member for Ynys M\u00f4n (Albert Owen)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, also mentioned. Also relevant is the fact that North sea oil has traditionally been better suited for the production of unleaded petrol than for diesel. However, it does seem extraordinary that one can drive across most of Europe seeing prices for diesel consistently lower than those for unleaded, only to arrive in this country and find that there is a 7p differential in the other direction.

Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr McCann)</phrase> acknowledged, the Government have to pay attention to balancing the budget. The motion notes, however, that fuel duty revenues are lower now than they were in 2008 despite the fact that the level of taxation has increased since. In my view, that makes but understates the case for rethinking further increases. As I have argued in Westminster Hall debates, that case was admirably set out by the Office for Budget Responsibility when it first looked at, and then rejected, the idea of a fair fuel stabiliser. It concluded that although higher prices added to Government revenues in the short term, by increasing the take from fuel duty, their longer-term impact was to reduce Government revenue through the combination of discouraging usage and the wider negative impacts of high fuel costs on the economy. Although the OBR used this argument to reject the original plan for a stabiliser, I have said many times that the logic of its argument is that lower fuel duties could result in higher tax revenues, and I am happy to put that case again today.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.778.0/4\">We should look not only at the impact on fuel duty receipts themselves, substantial though they might be, but consider the effect of sky-high prices on business profits and thence corporation tax, their impact on the rate of inflation and thus the rate of increase in costs to Government in everything from wage inflation to benefit uprating.

It is important, and he will know that in the previous Parliament there were a number of debates on the subject and a number of attempts in Finance Bills to introduce a fuel duty regulator\u2014precisely the price stabilisation mechanism that he describes in the motion today.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.769.1/2\">Going back over such debates from the previous Parliament is quite instructive, because it tells us why there is such anger among the general public. In the report of a debate in 2005 we read that the price of unleaded petrol had risen to 86p a litre, a rise of 6p in six months; by <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2008-05-15\">15 May 2008</phrase> it had gone up to something over \u00a31.10 a litre; and by the time of the Finance Bill debate in July 2008 it averaged \u00a31.32 a litre.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.769.1/3\">The underlying price is more intriguing, however. In 2005 Brent crude had risen to $60 a barrel, up a massive $10 on the previous year. By the time of the debate on the 2007 pre-Budget report it had risen to around $84 a barrel. In the run-up to the 2008 Budget the price was $94 a barrel. As someone mentioned earlier, prices crashed through and spiked at around $140 a barrel. This week the price has stabilised at $114 a barrel, but the price at the pump has risen inexorably.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.769.1/4\">From 86p a litre in 2005, diesel prices in Dundee this week had risen as high as 140p a litre\u2014\u00a36.40 a gallon. In the constituency of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury diesel was nearly 145p a litre\u2014\u00a36.60 a gallon. In Kirkwall, in the constituency of the Liberal Deputy Chief Whip, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40469\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase>, diesel is 152p a litre\u2014\u00a36.90 gallon\u2014and in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40413\" name=\"Angus MacNeil\">the Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil)</phrase> it is almost \u00a31.54 a litre. That is \u00a37 a gallon, so it now costs \u00a390 to fill up the tank of the average family saloon car. One can quickly see why people are so angry.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.769.1/5\">In our past debates, we heard about support outside Parliament from many organisations. The Road Haulage Association said:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.769.1/6\">\u201cUK hauliers are struggling as never before to cope with continually rising fuel prices\u201d.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.769.1/7\">Nothing has changed.

It will not be lost on colleagues that petrol companies quickly put up prices on the forecourt when there is an increase in the price of a barrel of oil, but are much slower to reduce them when the price of a barrel comes down.

For example, hauliers will be looking to ensure that their vehicles are running as efficiently as possible, yet on the European stage there is the possibility of a reduction in the height of trailers to 4 metres, which will have a negative impact on our haulage industry in the United Kingdom, exacerbate the problem of the price of fuel and increase the need for a cut in the fuel duty.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.766.3/2\">As has been said, a temporary VAT cut would be absolutely the right thing to do to secure an immediate impact for the domestic motorist, but something different is needed for the haulage industry in the longer term.

Indeed, the October AA monthly fuel price report highlighted that summer prices\u2014those from April to mid-October\u2014compared with those in 2010 were on average 17.5p per litre higher for petrol and 19.7p higher for diesel. These high price increases are an important element of the wider financial squeeze that so many middle and low-income families are currently experiencing.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.759.2/3\">New AA research published yesterday also underlined the fact that less well-off drivers have suffered more since the price of fuel peaked earlier this year. The research shows that those cutting back on car use and/or other spending rose dramatically among those living on lower incomes. That is a very worrying development. The constituents who have contacted me over the last few weeks are absolutely clear about what they want: lower fuel duty and lower fuel prices at the pumps.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.759.2/4\">On fuel duty, the Conservatives in opposition said that pump prices would be benchmarked and allowed only to move by 5p per litre in either direction, in response to the changing price of oil. The limited fair fuel stabiliser plan announced in the Budget does not equate to what the public might expect from a fuel duty stabiliser. Commenting after the Budget announcement, Edmund King, the president of the AA, said:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.759.2/5\">\u201cIn effect it is a stabiliser on an escalator rather than a stabiliser on prices. It does not reduce prices. All it does is to reduce increases in duty.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.759.2/6\">That is not what consumers were expecting and, as the motion states, it is time for the Government to look again at a \u201cprice stabilisation mechanism\u201d.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.759.2/7\">When the Government increased VAT to 20% in January, they contributed to a further increase in fuel prices. It was the wrong tax at the wrong time, and it has kept petrol prices high and hit economic growth. I support the call, along with my Labour colleagues, for a temporary VAT cut to 17.5%, which would immediately bring the cost of fuel down by about 3p a litre.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.759.2/8\">We must also be grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061\" name=\"John Mann\">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> for the excellent research that he published earlier this year on the political responsibility for increases in fuel duty. His revealing figures show that Conservative Governments have presided over increases in duty and VAT that have actually cost motorists twice as much as increases made by Labour Administrations. His figures demonstrate clearly that Labour Members have always been on the side of the ordinary motorist and the business person, whereas the Conservatives have been content to use fuel duties as a punitive means of raising revenue.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Graeme Morrice", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40374", "column": "", "time": "015:57:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.759.2", "house": "commons"}

In particular, fuel companies are not willing to extend credit terms, with the result that some payments are shrinking to as little as three days\u2019 worth. As haulage firms are often not paid for work for up to 60 days, this is very much a hand-to-mouth industry, and companies can afford to think only as far as January. That hinders growth, investment and further recruitment.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.758.3/3\">There are about 100 Freight Transport Association members in my constituency, which is, of course, close to a deep-sea port. Fuel duty is lower on the continent, and \u00a31,000-worth of diesel purchased on the continent can give over 200 extra miles to the driver. That has led to European businesses becoming more competitive than their UK counterparts, further heightening the pressure on domestic hauliers.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.758.3/4\">I acknowledge that we are facing a very difficult economic situation, and that we need to take robust steps to tackle the deficit, and I also know that the planned rises are less than the previous Government had intended. It is a relief to constituents that the Government delayed the scheduled tax rises and have introduced a fuel stabiliser but, like others supporting this motion, I want us to have a stabilisation mechanism under which duty rises and falls in response to fluctuations in the underlying price of oil.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.758.3/5\">As I am a member of the Environmental Audit Committee, it would be wrong of me not to mention the impact motorists and hauliers have on our nation\u2019s carbon footprint, but fuel taxation is a blunt instrument and the reality is that people in rural areas are having to bear the additional cost as they often have to make the same essential journeys as before.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.758.3/6\">There are alternatives to petrol and diesel that are more environmentally friendly. One of them is biodiesel, produced from used cooking oil. Over the last year, 99 million litres of used cooking oil was collected from restaurants, food manufacturers and caterers. It is an entirely sustainable fuel derived from a waste product and devoid of some of the negative impacts traditionally associated with biofuels. Therefore, if taxation on fuel is partly about encouraging behavioural change, rather than just being about revenue raising, the Government should encourage the use of this fuel, rather than see it as another target for increasing duty. The removal of the 20p per litre duty differential on this type of fuel, which is an excellent source of green energy, sends entirely the wrong message.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Caroline Nokes", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40505", "column": "", "time": "015:50:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.758.3", "house": "commons"}

Prices show no sign of coming down, however, so I hope that the Government will listen to everyone who has signed the motion and spoken in the debate, and not proceed with the January fuel duty increase.

I will explain the reasons for that later. My amendment went into some of the details that need to be addressed to help hard-working families.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.749.2/2\">Like many Members, about four or five weeks ago I started to receive letters from constituents on this issue, mainly prompted by the FairFuelUK campaign. At the time I wrote back to my constituents to tell them that I could not support the campaign because it called for tax cuts without saying how they would be paid for. I have little time for campaigns by the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Daily Express</i>, FairFuelUK or the TaxPayers Alliance, which are extreme right-wing organisations that promote tax cuts at the expense of public services.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.749.2/3\">However, I have now changed my mind after speaking to some of my constituents. There is no doubt in my mind that high fuel prices are having a tremendous impact on many low-paid and middle-paid families in my constituency. It is clear that the Government have no idea about the impact that high fuel prices are having on many constituents around the country. It is also clear that they have no understanding of the impact that wage freezes, high inflation, tax increases and high unemployment are having on the general public and the economy. Many of my constituents will have no pay increase for two years. Prices go up in the shops virtually every week. Heating and petrol prices are a particular problem for many of my constituents, and many of them are struggling to stay afloat.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.749.2/4\">The second reason why I support the campaign is the fact that the decision by the Liberal Democrats and the Tories to raise VAT to 20% has had a massive impact on the cost of living and on my community. It has made the situation worse. We have now had a flatlining economy for 18 months and unemployment is at a 17-year high. Those who believe that the motion will address those issues are sadly mistaken.

I apologise to my hon. Friend.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.748.4/2\">I will turn to the social impact. In Harlow, the cheapest unleaded petrol costs \u00a31.33 per litre. Most Harlow motorists are therefore spending \u00a31,700 a year just to fill their tanks. For most people, that is the equivalent of \u00a32,200 of income before tax\u2014a tenth of the average Harlow salary. I met a Harlow man called Mr Barry Metcalf a few weeks ago. He is self-employed and uses his own car to commute to West Ham for work. He spends nearly \u00a360 a week on fuel and has seen a 35% increase in the past year or two. The Government define fuel poverty as spending a tenth of one\u2019s income on heating bills. What about spending a tenth of one\u2019s income just on driving to work?</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.748.4/3\">Of that \u00a31,700, about \u00a31,000 is taxation. That is why fuel duty is like a second income tax. The Office for National Statistics confirmed yesterday that fuel duty is regressive and that the poorest are hit twice as hard as the richest. Fuel duty is not just about economics; it is an issue of social justice. That is especially true in rural communities, which are being destroyed by fuel prices.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.748.4/4\">In conclusion, there is a strong financial, economic and social case for cutting fuel taxes. That is why we urge the Government to scrap the planned 4p fuel duty increases that are scheduled for January and August 2012; to create a genuine price stabilisation mechanism that smoothes out fluctuations in the pump price; to pressurise the big oil companies to pass on cheaper oil to motorists; and to set up a commission to look at</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.748.4/5\">market competitiveness and radical ways of cutting fuel taxes in the long term. There is an ethical case too. We must show that tax cutting is a moral creed. We must show that this is a Government for the many, not for the few; a Government who cut taxes for millions of British people, not just for millionaires. I urge the Government to listen to the 116 MPs who have signed the motion; to the 110,000 people who have signed the FairFuelUK e-petition; and to the many millions of families, small businesses and pensioners who are struggling with fuel costs.

Evidence suggests that we are on the wrong side of the Laffer curve and that lower taxes might increase revenues. The Government\u2019s own figures show that between January and June this year 1.7 billion fewer litres of petrol and diesel were sold compared with the first half of 2008. The AA has done its analysis and says that this equates to \u00a31 billion in lost revenue for the Treasury. As the Chancellor said earlier this year, we must put fuel into the tank of the British economy, and cutting fuel tax is the way to do it. The economic impact of this is disastrous.

Member for Aberdeen North (Mr Doran)</phrase> and his colleagues on the all-party fisheries group for bringing this issue to the House, and the Backbench Business Committee for supporting it. This debate leads on well from our debate in May, which my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40500\" name=\"Zac Goldsmith\">the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith)</phrase> brought to the House, and if Members support the motion they will give me and the Government</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/2\">a mandate to continue our work to introduce some common-sense reform to a failed policy, and to take forward proposals that will greatly advantage the industry and our marine environment.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/3\">I should like to take this opportunity, however, to recall the six fishermen who have lost their lives this year in the line of their work at sea and in the harbour. We must remember the courage and sacrifice of individual fishermen, who put their lives in danger to bring food to our tables. Today is especially poignant, given our memory of Neil Murray, the husband of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546\" name=\"Sheryll Murray\">the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase>, to whom many Members have referred, and I know that the House will wish to join me in sending sincere condolences to all those families and friends who have suffered losses.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/4\">I shall try to cover as many points as I possibly can.

Member for Aberdeen North and any other groups of hon. Members.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/5\">The hon. Gentleman talked about the manifest failing of the common fisheries policy and found a ready audience in the House and, certainly, with me. He spoke about discards, as did several hon. Members, and it is important that our reforms on discards\u2014I think that these were his words\u2014reflect the reality of fishing. It is absolutely vital that we do so on a stock-by-stock, sea-basin and species-by-species basis and secure a workable result that delivers not just what the 700,000 people who signed up to the Fish Fight campaign want, but a sustainable solution for the fishing industry.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/6\">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the landing of black fish, and let the House be absolutely clear: those who land fish illegally are stealing fish from their fellow fishermen, so it is absolutely vital that we do all we can to crack down on that practice. He spoke also about regionalisation, as did a great many other Members, and about the welcome addition of the regional advisory councils in the 2002 reforms, and I absolutely agree that that is the basis on which we should talk, using a sea-basin approach to the management of our fisheries.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/7\">I want to see regionalisation work, but I concede the concerns, raised by hon. Members from all parts, that regionalisation in its current form could lead perversely to an increase in the Commission\u2019s powers. That is not what we want, and we will push very hard to ensure that regionalisation is effectively that.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/8\">The hon. Gentleman and several others raised another point, about the proposed cuts in the December round to those stocks where there is data-deficiency. We won a very important argument in the Baltic round of negotiations last month, noting that the arbitrary 25% or 15% cuts on the basis of a lack of evidence was completely illogical. It results in more discards, in poverty and in people going out of business, and we won that point. It remains on the table for the December round, but the principle has been won and we will drive it home, because it is really important.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.738.2/9\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605\" name=\"Anne McIntosh\">the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, the Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, made a very important point when she spoke about her Committee\u2019s desire to see more work on marketing less popular fish. DEFRA is doing that. We set up the \u201cFishing for the Markets\u201d project, and among other things we are undertaking a land-all scheme in North Shields. Indeed, we have been doing so for a long time\u2014for well over a year\u2014and it is paying dividends.

In Europe we are eating more fish than ever before. We have hit an historic peak and the projections for the next 30 years show that consumption will continue to rise.

That is the hope, but as ever the devil will be in the detail and in how strongly the Government argue and negotiate for UK fisheries and use regionalisation to respond to the needs of fishing communities.

It is essential that the UK has the strongest possible voice in these negotiations.

Can the Minister assure the House that the Secretary of State is fully engaged and will perform similar political contortions to get the best possible deal for the UK on fisheries reform?

Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40285\" name=\"Austin Mitchell\">the Member for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell)</phrase> mentioned. The current top-down approach has failed to achieve its objectives. Radical reform is necessary. The new CFP must ensure that fisheries management is dealt with at the most appropriate level. Without genuine decentralisation of fisheries management, it is difficult to imagine that sustainable management will be achieved. To that end, I welcome the proposals for multi-annual plans devised by member states, which the Commission intends as a central tool for ensuring that fish stocks are kept at sustainable levels and achieve maximum sustainable yields. It is vital that the Minister works closely with stakeholders in that process.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.736.1/7\">The collaborative approach will be particularly important in the plans to eliminate discards under the basic regulation within the multi-annual plans. In some EU fisheries 60% of catches are discarded. Discarding is a symptom of the poor management and practice of the current CFP. Much of the focus of the current proposals is on landing all catches of the main commercial species, but there is a real danger that discards overboard will become discards ashore.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Fiona O'Donnell", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40230", "column": "", "time": "014:40:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.736.1", "house": "commons"}

We have much more to gain than they have to lose, because our fisheries are among the largest in the EU and the restoration of a 200-mile limit, or a 50% limit where there are adjacent countries, would solve the problems for us, certainly for our fishermen and for our fish stocks.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.735.1/3\">I had wanted to say much more but realise that time is short.

The fleet needs to be enfranchised and we must move away from the current system of quota control that lacks flexibility and transparency. The Minister has commendably put forward proposals for the future management of English fisheries.

I commend him for introducing the pilot scheme that will operate from January.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.734.0/3\">However, there is a real concern that a rights-based method of control is not in the best interest for the under-10s. The problem is that there is no easily defined starting reference point on which to base a fair allocation for them. There is also the worry that globally there is evidence that rights-based systems do not work and quickly result in the loss of quota for the inshore sector.

There will be no mourning its loss by anyone I know or have come into contact with.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.733.0/2\">Much has been made of the issue of decentralising or regionalising fisheries management, which I agree would be a positive step forward. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40285\" name=\"Austin Mitchell\">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell)</phrase> and others have mentioned that, but there are those in the European Commission who suggest that post-Lisbon it is illegal to decentralise any meaningful responsibilities to the regions. Therefore, although I fully support the motion and join in the call for the Government to ensure that particular provision is made for regional management, I too would like to hear what the Minister believes is legally possible and how we can achieve that collectively.

The fishermen come to meet me with their list of things that they want me to do every month.

All those are key issues for the fishing industry.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.733.0/4\">Northern Ireland\u2019s fishing industry has instituted measures that have been introduced voluntarily which have cut discards of haddock and whiting by over 60%, yet go unrecognised by the European Commission\u2014nobody in the European Commission seems to have any idea what is going on. As with most other good points concerning the fishermen, if the scientists have not marked it in their book, it could not possibly be happening. If the 25% cuts go ahead, the white fish sector in Northern Ireland is finished for ever. I know the Minister will be batting for us in the meetings in December.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.733.0/5\">Locally, to address the issue of discards, our fisherman have had to incorporate various EU-legislated panels in their nets, which did little, if anything, for discard reduction, before they could deploy the gear designed specifically for use in the Irish sea. So it was true\u2014the net designed by our fishermen, which would have reduced discards, was effectively outlawed by Europe. That concerns me.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.733.0/6\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-11-10\">10 November</phrase> there was a meeting to impose emergency technical conservation measures in western waters. I am told that national Administrations will have little input into the process, which is politically driven by the EU\u2019s Greek Fisheries Commissioner. Let us be honest: if we pair the word \u201cGreek\u201d with the words \u201cFisheries Commissioner\u201d, we can understand why fishermen\u2019s knees are knocking.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.733.0/7\">The industry, like fisheries managers, has as a goal the reduction of unwanted catches to a minimum, but the fishing industry will not be made greener by driving it into the red. We must be honest about what we are doing. In a little over four weeks the Minister will be leading the UK team at the EU\u2019s annual December Fisheries Council. I urge him to support the industry at home.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.733.0/8\">Finally, the three-point plan for the Irish sea is clear. There should be a pause in further implementation of the long-term cod recovery plan. We should secure a rollover on the area VII nephrop TAC, which has been successfully managed for more than 40 years and remains stable, and we should seek an increase in the Irish sea herring quota, a stock which is at its largest for 18 years. It is time our fishermen see some reward for the sacrifices they have made in the face of the EU\u2019s ever-moving goalposts.

The National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations has suggested that member states co-operating with regional advisory councils at sea area level to prepare multi-annual management plans could result in de facto regional management. Will the Minister please explore these alternative routes with the NFFO?</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.732.4/3\">On the 12-mile limit, there is a case for ending the 40-year-old access rights. We see from the regulations that France has access to 15 areas within our territorial waters, Ireland to two areas, Germany to six, the Netherlands to three and Belgium to five for a variety of species, whereas the UK gains access to two areas within German waters and one area within French waters. This is not fair. I have even heard that some Belgian vessels working in the Bristol channel have changed from beam trawling to demersal twin rigging to work inside the 12-mile limit. Some of these could be Netherlands- owned Belgian-registered flag of convenience vessels. Exclusive access to the 12-mile limit could help the under-10 metre fleet.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.732.4/4\">I welcome the move to ban discards, but that is not a simple as it may seem.

The UK, the Netherlands and Denmark already operate a similar system, which has been shown to control effort,</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.732.4/6\">but this was always preceded by decommissioning. Does the Minister agree that for a system of transferrable fishing concessions to work, there needs to be substantial decommissioning beforehand?</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.732.4/7\">This is the only chance that we have to raise the 2012 quotas.

My words are as true today as they were when they were first spoken. I am pleased that we have a Minister who has already shown that he shares my sentiments.

I hope that the Minister will spell out the mechanisms and processes that are under consideration and how they might be made fit for purpose, because there is a great deal at stake for our fishing communities.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.1/5\">There is a great deal to be learned from the experience of regional advisory councils on the value of long-term planning and the need to bringing fishing industry representatives into the decision-making process. There is a great deal, too, that we can learn from the efforts of our fishermen in recent years to put the industry on an environmentally sustainable footing. The Scottish fleet has been at the forefront of efforts to push alternatives to discarding, but when we discuss discards it is crucial to remember that they are a direct consequence of the impositions put on fishermen by the failed CFP. No one gains from discards.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.1/6\">In that respect, the catch quota pilot schemes in Scotland and England have shown real potential. They were trialled to see how good they were at cutting discards and improving the economic viability of vessels, and they have been extremely effective. So far, however, only a relatively small number of vessels have been able to benefit from them. More boats could benefit, and I urge the Minister to prioritise the issue with our international partners, particularly the Norwegians and the European Commission, and drive it forward so that we can expand the catch quota system and build on the success of the model across the EU.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.1/7\">The Scottish fleet has been more successful than any other European fleet in ending discards. Catch quotas are only one factor in that success: the conservation credit scheme, using selective gear and real-time closures, is the thing that have really made a difference by improving the sustainability of our fisheries, as has longer-term planning and sound science. Too often, science has been used to justify policy making of dubious quality, and it has sometimes been used as a blunt instrument. It has been made to say what policy makers want it to say. There is now widespread recognition that good science and sound scientific data are beneficial to everyone, but if we want to build trust in scientific data we have to use them consistently. When the scientific data show that stocks are healthy and fish are plentiful, we need commensurate increases in total allowable catches. The forthcoming Council meeting could not be more timely, as we should not have more quota cuts if the science says that that is not necessary.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.1/8\">Consistency is required.

A year or two ago I went to Falmouth, where we were trying to secure more help for sea anglers, who play an important part in the fishing industry, not only by catching fish but by bringing people down to Falmouth, the west country and other parts of the United Kingdom, where they stay in hotels and so on. The value of a fish caught by an angler can be a great deal more than that of a fish caught by a professional fisherman. I know that the Minister takes that dimension very seriously.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.0/2\">I want to discuss the change in fishing gear and the 50:50 process in Devon, where discards have been reduced by 50%, which is good news. Until we ban discards and land everything that we catch, how do we know what there is in the seas? Up to 2 million tonnes of fish throughout the European Union are discarded every year, which is a huge waste of resources, and means that we never quite know what the stocks are.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.0/3\">I welcome the Commission\u2019s proposal on landing fish that is not fit for human consumption, suggesting that it should be made into fishmeal to be fed to farmed fish. However, I question its proposal on the landing of fresh fish, which would be kept and distributed to poor people throughout Europe\u2014not that I am against poor people throughout Europe and the UK having fish, but the idea that the Commission will organise that in every port in the EU, especially in the UK, fills me with horror. Some of those proposals need to be considered carefully.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.730.0/4\">Of course we should ban discards\u2014I know that the Minister has done a great deal of work on this, as have celebrity chefs\u2014but about 70% of the fish landed in Newlyn harbour goes straight in a lorry to Spain, because we do not eat that type of fish.

In that context, who are we to believe? Is it the individuals, including some in the Commission, who offer up European Union treaties as the reason why any meaningful decentralisation is illegal? Or it is those who yearn to be regarded as the voices of reason within the Commission, and ask for our trust? For me, so far the evidence suggests that it is the former, although I want it to be the latter.

They are concerned about the marine protected areas, and the quality of evidence being offered to my hon. Friend by his statutory advisers at Natural England and the Marine Management Organisation. Two weeks ago, in an Adjournment debate secured by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546\" name=\"Sheryll Murray\">the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase>, I raised my concerns about the lack of transparency in the evidence-gathering process.

The scallop-fishing industry is an important export market that brings much-needed revenue and jobs to the Plymouth travel-to-work area. I am told that it is worth about \u00a320 million. Recently, for the first time, western waters area VII was closed to UK vessels for scallop fishing. The area has recently been reopened, but problems and challenges remain. I hear that the UK has been at risk of reaching the kilowatt-days limit since 2009, which is before my hon. Friend took up his post.

I want to make two points about the west coast of Scotland: about mesh sizes in the Minch for prawns and about catch composition, particularly for haddock. There seems to be an abundance of haddock on the west coast of the Hebrides inside the area known as the French line, which is about 100 fathoms or 200 metres deep, and it seems that the haddock are migrating into the Minch and around the prawn fishery. It should be good news that there is an abundance of haddock, but that abundance is becoming very bad news indeed, because EU catch composition rules mean that no more than 30% of catches can consist of haddock, cod or whiting. If a trip catches quite a lot of haddock, what should have been good news is not good news if there are not enough prawns to get that haddock landed, because it is not allowed to make up more than 30% of the catch. In that case, only a fraction of the haddock caught can be landed.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.726.1/2\">Haddock is abundant and tasty, and many people in Scotland prefer it to cod, but if they cannot get haddock they will eat cod, and that makes the situation worse. The basis of the problem is the cod recovery plan. Surely we should take haddock out of the catch composition rules, particularly for the west coast of Scotland, where many fishermen\u2019s leaders and merchants tell me there is an abundance of haddock. That underlines the silliness, folly and lunacy of the common fisheries policy. The cod recovery plan prevents haddock from being landed, which will probably mean that more cod is eaten. That is almost a comedy, but as we all know, it quickly ends up in the usual common fisheries policy tragedy.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.726.1/3\">Fishermen\u2019s leaders on the west coast have expressed concern to me about a potential increase in mesh size in the Minch from 80 mm to 95 mm for prawns, especially as the size increased from 70 mm to 80 mm two years ago. The change would, of course, have catch implications for the smaller community boats, on which many local islanders work. The change should not be made now, just when Scottish Government scientists are undertaking technical trials, and in particular it should not apply to boats with an engine of under 300 hp, due to the disproportionate cost of gear change for them.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.726.1/4\">The prawn area in the west coast fishery seems to be in balance at the moment; people seem reasonably happy, although they are worried about some of the measures on the horizon, such as the mesh size proposals. However, they feel that there is a major problem with haddock. Ironically, the problem is caused not by a lack of haddock but by an abundance of it. I would be particularly grateful to the Minister if he looked at ways of removing haddock from the catch composition rules on the west coast.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.726.1/5\">I have participated in many debates on the common fisheries policy and fishing, and I feel that not a blind bit of notice is ever taken of them in Europe. Earlier this year I was in the Faroe Islands for the \u201cSeas the Future\u201d conference with people from Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Denmark and Scotland. At the end, officials from the EU talked about the CFP. They asked why I was complaining about the CFP in T\u00f3rshavn in the Faroe Islands; would I not come to talk to them in Brussels? It occurred to me that surely there are places besides this Parliament\u2014democratically elected places\u2014where the common fisheries policy is discussed, but are we talking into a vacuum? Surely we should have people in this Chamber listening, at least, to the complaints that Members of all parties express about the common fisheries policy. What actually happens is that one person leaves this Chamber, meets people from other chambers, and ends up having to horse-trade on the common fisheries policy. Ultimately, as we have seen over the years, fishing has been the loser.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Angus MacNeil", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40413", "column": "", "time": "014:08:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.726.1", "house": "commons"}

I strongly support the motion, which highlights the key points in the broad-brush approach of responding to the failure of the common fisheries policy, addressing in particular the problem of centralised management, the need for a more regionally controlled method for eliminating the problem of discarded fish and the need for a multi-annual basis for the future management of the common fisheries policy. Those who, like the hon. Member for Aberdeen North and I, have engaged in these debates over many years will reflect on the degree of consensus that has emerged in the past decade.

I have taken a delegation from my constituency to see the Minister about this and he knows that there is</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.725.3/4\">significant alarm and concern about the impact that the reforms might have on the under 10 metre sector, not least in relation to the reference period that has been used by the Government for the possible future allocation of quota in forthcoming years.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.725.3/5\">In the Government\u2019s response to the consultation, which came out a fortnight ago, the Minister announced the intention to try alternative management approaches before introducing far-reaching changes to the current system. The intention is to launch three pilot schemes next year. Having discussed this with fishermen around the coast of my constituency, I know that there is enthusiasm for putting forward the west of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly as a potential area in which a pilot scheme might be advanced. That could be a means by which the area might have some influence over the future development of that policy.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.725.3/6\">The second issue I want to address is the need to make sure not only that scientists work with fishermen but that fishermen work with scientists. My constituent Shaun Edwards and his crew saved 47 passengers in heavy seas from the dismantled Fryderyk Chopin vessel 100 miles south-west of the Isles of Scilly on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-10-28\">28 October</phrase> last year.

A more flexible date for that target would therefore be of great help to our fishing industry. Northumberland IFCA also feels that achieving maximum sustainable yield will be crucial to determining multi-annual plans, which, with an ambitious target date of 2015, could create the danger of unnecessary fisheries closures. The emphasis should be on local measures that will ensure sustainable and viable fisheries, such as the lobster V-notching permit scheme and pot limitation, with buy-in from the local industry, which currently operate in Northumberland.

That was a key part of the motion, but since the EU Commission published its proposals it has curiously slipped off the agenda and out of the debate. I asked the Minister about this matter in a recent letter and his response implied that I, and by extension the House, wanted to achieve this control by removing the historical rights of other countries.

I repeat that we have to avoid the situation, which has been well documented, where we impose laws to protect dolphins and porpoises, and restrict the trawling for bass.

Before the previous election that was Conservative party policy and I was sorry to see it changed, although it is still a policy to which the Government are attached. They wish to repatriate powers from Europe, and if ever there was a case for doing so it is in respect of fishing, because the blanket command-and-control policy operated from Brussels, with centrally decided political decisions, is not working, cannot be made to work and has to be ended. That means that we have to transfer power down</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.721.2/2\">to the regional advisory councils, which have been very successful, having been established only in 2002. They have been a major success but they need powers to allocate quotas, to impose conservation and technical measures, and to enforce those quotas. That means that they must have not only some fast-track powers of implementation, so that the whole thing does not get held up in the Brussels bottleneck, but the finance and staffing to do the job properly.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.721.2/3\">Therefore, we must, first, fulfil the rather vague aspiration in the Commission\u2019s own document of transferring powers down to the RACs to give them the control of management. They need to work with the producer organisations; they need to involve the industry in deciding and managing its own fate. That is best done through the producer organisations, by giving them power. They have been very good at managing their quotas in their own areas and that power needs to be extended. If we are to have transferable quotas, as the Commission specifies, there have to be transfers within the producer organisations, rather than sales to foreign owners, as happened so much in respect of Spanish vessels. There needs to be a transfer of quotas within the individual POs so that we keep quotas locally. The producer organisations have to play a part, with the industry taking the lead.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.721.2/4\">We have to point out to the Minister\u2014I am sure that he is aware of this\u2014that the last vestiges of this command-and-control economy are the Commission\u2019s proposals to cut the quotas, which were mentioned by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40428\" name=\"Ian Paisley Jnr\">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley)</phrase>. They are the last vestige of the ancien r\u00e9gime that the Commission is trying for, and they have to be imposed at the December Council. That is because the cuts in the quota that the Commission is proposing do not follow the advice of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. ICES says that there should be no increase in quota, but the Commission has translated that into a 25% reduction, which is ludicrous. So, too, is the other proposal, for which ICES does not provide an analytical assessment of what has to be done, that there should be a 15% cut. If that is passed by the December Council and comes into the process of co-determination with the European Parliament, we could be stuck with that decision until 2014, which would be ludicrous. It would be damaging to the industry and it would leave us with a huge cut in domestic fleets.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.721.2/5\">The Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation\u2014the hon. Member for North Antrim has just concurred with this point\u2014calculates that if the proposed cuts are enforced on the white fish and the prawn fleets in Scotland, they will be able to fish for only four days a fortnight. They will not be able to make a profit and they will be forced to lay up. This will decimate our fleet for a goal that is mistaken and has no scientific basis, so it is vital that the Minister overturns those cuts and opposes further cuts as part of the cod recovery plans. Cuts in quota will mean more discards.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.721.2/6\">I have two other points to make. One is that we have to accept that all fish should be landed, not discarded. The fishermen can be paid a management fee\u2014the cost of landing and marketing, and no more\u2014but that will allow us to record all the catches actually made. Secondly, we need to end the system of buying quota from poor African countries, which is a kind of fishing imperialism, where huge Spanish vessels are going in, damaging the</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.721.2/7\">local industry, crushing the local boats, in many cases, and stopping the recovery. There can be management arrangements to assist people in managing their stocks and to help them, but there should be no buying of quota, at our expense, to crush the local industry. The times are better than how they have been portrayed and the stocks are recovering, but now is the time to take a firm stand and get the powers transferred back down to the regional advisory councils to save our industry.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Austin Mitchell", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40285", "column": "", "time": "013:51:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.721.2", "house": "commons"}

We should bear in mind that most inshore fishermen have a vested interest in sustainability. They want to go out day after day, and they want their sons and brothers to go out as well. They want a sustainable industry. The problem is the boats that do not care about sustainability: the Spanish trawlers that arrive once a year and take everything in sight.

Because the time spent in nets is so short inshore, the number of dead discards is much lower.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.717.0/6\">Seasonality is another issue. Both the <i>Sunday Times </i>article and an earlier speaker said that the quotas should take account of the variation that takes place during the year. Specific quotas for the whole year would cause fishermen\u2019s incomes to fluctuate in a way that they could not possibly manage. There should also be more flexibility in regard to the cost of licences. Fishermen need to be able to make a return, and, as we know, many with small boats are finding it extremely difficult to make a living.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.717.0/7\">I support the plea from my hon.

Now only six vessels operate from my constituency. The seas have been fished out. We need to state clearly that we have a fishing crisis and a conservation crisis. I hope that the British Government will enter the negotiations on the CFP with an ecosystem-based approach at the top of their agenda, because that is the only way in which we shall be able to create the space that will enable our ecosystem to redevelop.

We urge the Government to continue the work to find a market for less popular fish. I am delighted to see that that is part of Commissioner Damanaki\u2019s current thinking. It is also important to implement the excellent work done under the previous and the present Government on \u201cProject 50%\u201d. Fantastic work was done in a short period of time to reduce discards by employing more selective gear. We would like to see that project pushed out widely across English fisheries.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.715.4/4\">We press for a reduction in discards as a key element in the current common fisheries policy negotiations and we want to ensure that the interests of the under 10 metre fleet are represented in them.

I believe that the Minister is going forward in absolutely the right way by looking at pilot schemes. It has been put to me by the local fishermen that they are excluded at the moment from the cod and other quotas and that they are doing very nicely on a sustainable basis from lobster, crab and shellfish, so they do not wish to see their incomes penalised or jeopardised in any way.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.715.4/7\">I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeen North that we have not seen enough flesh on the bones of the Commission\u2019s proposals. That is causing great anxiety.

We send our condolences to her in particular.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/7\">The common fisheries policy was established in 1970, before Britain joined the then European Community. Many people believe that the industry was traded as part of wider negotiations on access to the community. That is certainly the view of many in the fishing industry today, and it has coloured their opinion of the CFP ever since. Whatever the circumstances, the British fishing industry changed for ever when this country acceded to the common market in 1973.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/8\">Experience tells us that the CFP has failed in its objectives. Its primary objective was the</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/9\">\u201crational and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks\u201d,</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/10\">but, over the life of the CFP, fish stocks have deteriorated considerably, as has our fishing fleet. The system is broken in several places. Decision making is centralised in Brussels, and it is far too complicated. The management style is far too top-down. Decision making is short term, and there is a one-size-fits-all culture. There are also serious issues with the science, but the science determines at least the direction of Council decisions on quotas. We have a system that operates on the basis that management measures and plans for EU stocks can all be created centrally by the Commission, that member states will enforce those rules, and that fishermen will obey them. To put it mildly, that does not reflect the reality of the fishing industry in Europe.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/11\">I should like to focus on two issues. The first is the problem of discards, which is high on the agenda. We are all opposed to the principle of good, saleable fish being thrown back into the sea. Television programmes,</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/12\">celebrities and many others outside and inside the fishing industry tell us that that is a bad thing, and of course it is a very bad thing. It is offensive to most of us, it is wasteful, it affects the viability and sustainability of fish stocks, and it distorts the science and scientific advice. It also deeply affects our fishermen, who are forced to throw perfectly good fish back into the sea to rot. The discard of fish is a direct consequence of the one-size-fits-all management approach by the European Commission and its strict adherence to a system of quotas applied to single species over the past 28 years.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/13\">The principle of the total allowable catch\u2014TAC\u2014system is questionable in itself, but the refusal to recognise that many fisheries are multi-species and require a much more sophisticated response is a significant sign of the inability of the present system to meet the needs of the fishing industry. Despite the huge improvements made by fishermen, particularly in Scotland, to use more sophisticated gear and other methods to avoid by-catch, it is still a major problem that the Commission has failed to address.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/14\">Then there is the even more difficult subject of black fish. From the earliest days of the UK\u2019s membership of the CFP, that has been a problem, not just in the UK but across Europe. Until relatively recently, the subject was ignored by successive Governments. In the1970s, it was estimated that over 20% of the haddock caught in the North sea was illegally caught. Recent inquiries set up by Grampian police, Northern police and Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs have resulted in a number of convictions of fishermen and fish-processing companies.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/15\">One statistic from a report published in July by KPMG gives a good idea of the scale of the fraud that has been uncovered. The report looked at crime in the corporate world in the first six months of this year, and it showed that, in Scotland, company fraud rose from \u00a32.8 million last year to \u00a394.1 million this year, of which \u00a391 million related to prosecutions for illegal fishing. The sums involved are huge. Everyone in the fishing industry knew that it was going on, and that goes right up to Ministers and their officials.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.711.1/16\">The fraud has had a number of consequences. One has been a serious distortion of the science, much of which is based on the recording of the details of individual landings. It is clear that, for many years, the recorded landings have been wrong. There have also been serious consequences for many of the businesses that refused to become involved in the black fish trade. Most of them lost trade, and many went bust because their customers could get cheaper fish on the black market.

Following new regulations introduced in Scotland in 2004 requiring the registration of fish sales companies, the problem of black fish seems to have been almost eradicated. However, black fish and discards are two areas in which the Fisheries Commission has been blind to the impact of its policies. The policies in both areas have been immensely damaging to the fishing industry, not just here in the UK but across Europe, and of course both practices distort the science on which the whole quota system is based.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Frank Doran", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40036", "column": "", "time": "013:10:00", "date": {"$date": 1321315200000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-15a.711.1", "house": "commons"}

According to the Energy Networks Association, metal theft from electricity networks rose by some 700% between June 2009 and June 2011. Organised crime has been involved in scaling the tallest electricity pylons and cutting down heavy tensile cable from the top of 275,000 V towers. The Association of Chief Police Officers has conservatively put the national cost of metal theft at \u00a3770 million. Figures from the British Transport police show that theft of overhead power cables has risen by 70% over the last year, with 2,712 cable-theft-related crimes registered in 2010-11. There are eight thefts or attempted thefts of railway cable every day, which has so far caused 240,000 minutes of delays to rail passengers this year and cost Network Rail \u00a343 million over the last two years.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/4\">Yesterday, representatives of South West Trains told me of an incident involving a train travelling at peak hours from London. Metal thieves cut and removed a signalling cable and then, while Network Rail repaired it, cut a further section. The live shock could have seriously injured or killed Network Rail staff, while packed commuter trains were left at a standstill. Delayed and besieged passengers began exiting trains by climbing the embankments, crossing the live third rail. The result was an even greater section of the rail network having to be switched off for safety reasons\u2014and this seven months before the Olympic games. In Burnley last week, something as simple as the theft of seven \u00a375 brass padlocks left electricity substations exposed to inquisitive children. The past year has also seen six fatalities and 50 serious injuries, and I am sure that everyone in the House has been shocked by the increasingly numerous stories of thefts from war memorials. War memorials are being stolen, sold and scrapped because the regulatory framework surrounding metal recycling is so ineffective. In combination with the soaring international price of metal, there are effectively incentives to steal.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/5\">Metal recycling is a valuable industry. It is a sustainable means of reusing an important and increasingly expensive commodity. However, the soft regulatory framework undermines that logic by encouraging thieves to take materials that are still in use. The problem lies precisely in the fact that it is stolen metal that is being recycled. My Bill will go some way to removing the incentives to steal created by weak regulation in the industry. This is not red tape; the intention is to reduce the costs to businesses and the public purse incurred through damage to the nation\u2019s infrastructure. Such regulation would allow legitimate, law-abiding and socially responsible</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/6\">scrap metal dealers to flourish. Indeed, a few scrap metal dealers already perform much of the requirements of the Bill in best practice.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/7\">Yesterday I met with representatives of SITA UK, a company that recently entered the metal recycling industry. They told me that they were shocked and appalled by the level of malpractice in the sector. The chief executive of SITA UK gave his full backing for the six elements of the Bill. So far, there has been no opposition from the affected industries to any of my six proposals. In fact, quite the reverse: they have received almost universal backing, with the concern now being that if we do not go far enough now, the problem will continue to escalate. The consensus in the industry is that the six measures in my Bill are vital if anything is to be done to stop the escalating crime. I now turn to those six provisions.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/8\">First, the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 must be amended so that the current registration regime can be replaced by a robust licensing regime that is funded by a licence fee paid by scrap metal dealers. That is the first step towards something resembling a regulated industry. Secondly, property obtained through theft should be regarded as criminal assets. Classifying stolen metal as criminal assets would allow the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to apply. Crucially, that will impact on those who think that they can evade any regulatory regime. Thirdly, police authorities should be given the power to search and investigate all premises owned and operated by scrap metal dealers suspected of dealing in stolen property, as well as the power to close scrap metal dealers where criminally obtained metals are discovered.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/9\">Fourthly\u2014there is a great deal of consensus in the affected industries on this point\u2014trade in scrap metals must be restricted to cashless payments, with a concurrent requirement that scrap metal not be sold or processed until payments have cleared. Minister may think that onerous, but such a system has been successfully implemented in France, Belgium and much of the United States. Alongside that, dealers should operate CCTV and require photo identification of sellers. Those measures would remove the anonymity of the seller and require honesty of the dealer. I have been informed by the industry that scrap metal is a \u00a35 billion industry, with an incredible \u00a31 billion estimated to be exchanged in cash payments. That amount of cash usage is unseen in any</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/10\">comparable, legitimate industry, and should also interest the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, if for no other reason than to verify its legality.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/11\">Fifthly, magistrates should be given the power to add restrictions to licences to deal in scrap metal, should they feel it necessary. Local knowledge is indispensible in addressing such crimes. Finally, the Theft Act 1968 should be amended so that sentencing is proportionate to the consequences of the crime, not the value of the metal stolen. A tougher sanctions regime is central to combating metal theft. That is important, because there has to be a realisation that we cannot police Britain\u2019s metal estate. We have to accept the reality that there will always be an opportunity to steal metal and get away with it. We must adjust the deterrent sentence accordingly. The tariff must also reflect the fact that the theft of scrap metal worth \u00a320 may cause \u00a3500,000 of damage or risk lives.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.708.2/12\">There is widespread support for the Bill in its current form. Yesterday I held a meeting in Parliament attended by representatives of BT, Network Rail, the Energy Networks Association, the Local Government Association, South West Trains, E.ON, Arqiva, Ecclesiastical Insurance and SITA UK, among others. They fully support the Bill in its entirety. In addition, I have received vocal support from the Country Land and Business Association and the Lancashire constabulary. It is now time for the UK to prevent this epidemic plague. Supporting the Bill is an important step in demonstrating that this House not only takes seriously the theft of our heritage, public art and vital infrastructure, and the protection of churches and war memorials against desecration, but is willing to support tough measures.

She has refused to come to the House and she has refused to do interviews for nearly two weeks.

She said that Brodie Clark went further than she authorised and admitted he had done so, but this morning Brodie Clark has said categorically that he did not. She said that the performance of the border agency improved this summer, but this morning the head of the statistics agency described that as a highly selective use of statistics that may, indeed, be in breach of the ministerial code.

In fact, the controls against high-risk private flights were strengthened, and that is entirely consistent with our overall approach to border security of using more intelligence-led checks against high-risk passengers and journeys. Far from weakening our border controls, those measures were aimed at strengthening our border.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.699.2/3\">Under the previous Government, it was clear that the UK Border Agency\u2019s procedures for private flights meant that some high-risk flights were missed, and this left our country open to the risk of drug smuggling, illegal immigration and gun running. In fact, the previous Government did not even have agreed definitions of high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk private flights, and there were no standard operational procedures: flights landing in one part of the country might be met by a UKBA team; the exact same flight landing somewhere else might not.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.699.2/4\">Indeed, under the previous Government, Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation, called private aviation the UK\u2019s \u201csoft underbelly\u201d. To get a grip on that chaotic situation, in January the UKBA developed a new strategy for private flights, with the aim of meeting 100% of all high-risk flights through the use of better intelligence and increased compliance, the greater use of the warnings index and a standardised risk-assessment procedure. It gave us for the first time a consistent national system for dealing with private aviation, and it drew on the resources of the police and other agencies to make sure that all high-risk flights were met.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.699.2/5\">The strategy makes use of the legal requirement for pilots to submit records of their passengers. Those are checked against the warnings index, and a full, standardised risk assessment is carried out. The UKBA will deploy officers to meet any flight on which police or other intelligence causes concern, or on which there is a warnings index hit. Local UKBA teams, field intelligence officers and the police then work to ensure a high level of compliance with these procedures, which are, for the first time, consistent across the country. In the view of UKBA senior management, the new strategy is finally getting on top of the risk from private aviation.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.699.2/6\">Everything that Ministers in this Government have authorised has been done to strengthen our borders: resources focused on high-risk passengers and journeys, a new strategy to sort out private aviation, a new National Crime Agency with a border policing command, e-Borders to check passengers in and out of the country, and tough enforcement. Some 400,000 visas were rejected last year and 68,000 people with the wrong documents were prevented from coming to Britain in the first place.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.699.2/7\">These particular operational changes were made to address a problem that had existed for years and had been identified but not acted on by the Government of whom the shadow Home Secretary was a member.

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356\" name=\"Greg Mulholland\">the Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> on not only securing the debate but leading a remarkable song of harmony. He talked about music to my ears, and I must say\u2014I say it with due care, as you are a professional Lancastrian, Mr Deputy Speaker\u2014that I have not seen quite so many Yorkshiremen together and singing in such harmony, not just from west and north but from the south part of Yorkshire as well. It is very nice to see and hear. I hope that that same harmony can be maintained as proposals are put forward.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/2\">If I may say, my hon. Friend put his case very effectively. I might also congratulate him on his genius of having 57 different points as to why we should have the green investment bank in Leeds but under only three headings. That was a masterful performance.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/3\">Let me say from the start as someone who regularly goes to Leeds that I totally share the view that it is a first-class city with many advantages and a strong commitment to going green in our economy. I thank, for example, the local enterprise partnership and its partners for the comprehensive business case they have submitted for locating the green investment bank in the city. I was lucky enough to be in Leeds just a few weeks ago at the unveiling of the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> business club, when I heard first hand just how much support there is for this institution to be located in the city.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/4\">The green investment bank is a key component of this Government\u2019s commitment to a transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy, which will complement other green policies, which I will touch on briefly later, to drive forward growth in the sector, which by 2009-10 was already worth some \u00a3116 billion.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/5\">As we have heard from several hon. Members, Leeds has a long and illustrious industrial history, often at the forefront of innovation. It is one of the UK\u2019s largest manufacturing bases. We have heard that it is home to many international businesses. Leeds has also been able to make that difficult transition from industrial powerhouse to a thriving hub for financial services. It is true that outside the City of London, it is the largest financial centre in the UK.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/6\">As several hon. Members have pointed out, Leeds has a number of other important emerging strengths, including environmental sciences, bioscience, and even digital and creative industries. Even in these challenging times, growth can clearly be seen in the increase in exports not just from Leeds, but from the Yorkshire and Humber region, which grew to \u00a33.8 billion in the first quarter of this year compared with last year. When I go to the city, I see a sense of confidence and optimism when I look, for example, at the investment of \u00a3350 million in the Trinity retail and leisure development, or at the \u00a360 million investment in Leeds arena.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/7\">As several hon. Members have said, the green economy has become increasingly important, and the Leeds city region demonstrates its focus on a sustainable economy in several ways. I had the pleasure of attending the official launch of the Aire valley enterprise zone. Its focus is on low-carbon industries and it expects to create up to 9,500 new jobs by 2025, and to add something in the region of \u00a3550 million of economic output to the city region. As my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Leeds North West mentioned, the enterprise zone in the nearby Humber region should generate nearly 5,000 jobs by 2015, particularly through its focus on offshore wind manufacturing.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/8\">When I went to the city, I was also struck\u2014several right hon. and hon. Members mentioned this\u2014that there is a genuine local commitment to going green in local initiatives, such as the better business environment forum or the Leeds climate change charter. Leeds is one of only four cities in the UK that is designated as an environment city. Local people recently celebrated the European year of volunteering environmental theme with projects including river cleaning, action mornings to maintain the Gledhow valley woods\u2014I am getting a generous nod so I trust my pronunciation was correct\u2014and a comprehensive scheme of planting bulbs and flowers in public places. That happens in other parts of the world regularly, but it is nevertheless part of that voluntary wish to recognise the value of a genuine sustainable community and economy.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/9\">I appreciate that there is a genuine commitment to a green, low-carbon future right across Leeds. Nationally, the Government are taking real action to try to put the whole economy on that path. Over the summer, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Energy and Climate Change published plans that map out the Government\u2019s approach to building the green economy and show what that means in practice for business. The plans set out the range of policies we are using to support the transition to a green economy and the opportunities that we have created, but also the implications for some of those traditional businesses, which, as various right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned, will need to change how they operate to develop in future.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/10\">We understand that to invest the substantial resources required in this area, business needs to be certain that the low-carbon sector is not a passing fad, as some sceptics might believe. That is why we are seeking to provide certainty and why, for example, we are committed by law to providing a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. We have launched the world\u2019s first incentive scheme for renewable heat, which should increase investment in green-heat technologies by \u00a37.5 billion by 2020. We have also announced the green deal, under which householders, businesses and landlords will be able to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and buildings at no up-front cost. We have also introduced a carbon price floor, proposals on electricity market reform and a range of initiatives to encourage the roll-out of low-carbon vehicles.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/11\">To that end, good progress is being made on the green investment bank. It will be the first of its kind in the world, which is why it is one of this Government\u2019s first priorities. Capitalised with \u00a33 billion, the green investment bank will complement other green policies</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/12\">to help accelerate the leveraging in of additional private capital. The key is that the green investment bank must be a new but enduring institution, rather than a series of Government interventions, and an institution that addresses the areas of under-investment that have persisted in spite of the other measures that I have mentioned. Our green objectives are ambitious, and to achieve them we need tailored and targeted financial intervention to overcome under-investment in those key areas. The green investment bank will work towards the double bottom line of both achieving significant green impact and making financial returns.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/13\">As we have seen from this and other debates in the House, there is a real interest in the operation of the green investment bank and how it will be established, so let me turn to that. To assist us, we have appointed an advisory group, led by Sir Adrian Montague, to advise on a range of issues, including not just the institution\u2019s strategic priorities, but the conditions and the market in which it will operate. The priorities will be decided by the Secretary of State and reviewed regularly by Ministers and the institution\u2019s corporate board.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/14\">The question at the heart of this debate is the bank\u2019s location. The location is critical to the bank\u2019s success, and although it will not be a large institution, it is clear that people already see it as a valuable organisation\u2014an asset, as I think one hon. Member described it\u2014to wherever it is located. I can tell the House that we have received applications from 20 cities and towns, including Leeds. They have indicated that they would like to be considered as the location of the green investment bank. We intend to set out the details of the criteria and</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/15\">the process for determining the location of the green investment bank before Christmas, in just a few weeks, with a view to making the final decision in 2012. Our proposals for the green investment bank will need to be approved by the European Commission before we can establish it as a fully independent financial institution. We expect approval by mid-2013. In the interim, to accelerate our transition to a green economy, the Government will begin making early investments in green infrastructure from April 2012.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/16\">We are committed to taking action now to enable the transition to a green and growing economy, and we welcome Leeds\u2019 active, positive and energetic contribution to this debate. We will continue to build on the progress that we have made, which is why we welcome the support from all the main political parties for the principle of an enduring and independent institution that will help to set the UK firmly on its course towards a green and growing economy.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/17\">To summarise briefly, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds North West on raising this important issue and emphasise that no decisions have yet been made\u2014if that is an assurance to him\u2014on the location of the bank. We will ensure a fair and transparent process when we decide on the location. All interested parties will be given an equal opportunity to submit an expression of interest, so that due consideration can be given to all submissions to ensure a full and equitable process.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/18\" class=\"italic\">Question put and agreed to.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.673.0/19\" class=\"italic\">House adjourned.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Mark Prisk", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313", "column": "", "time": "021:33:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.673.0", "house": "commons"}

Gentleman invites me there as part of \u201cTeam Leeds\u201d, I will be delighted to get my hard hat on and come and see it for myself.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/2\">Projects up and down the country are already being advised and structured by companies from the Leeds city region. The only biomethane project in the United Kingdom to be completed, in Didcot, was assisted by advice and structuring from the region. As the Minister has heard clearly\u2014I hope the message has got out\u2014the Leeds city region is involved in developing economically sustainable businesses in the green and low-carbon sectors not just in the region, or in the United Kingdom, but around the world.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/3\">The third and final key reason why the green investment bank should be based in the Leeds city region is one that I know is music to any Minister\u2019s ears in the current economic climate. The region offers outstanding value for money, through available and affordable office space and competitive staffing, recruitment and location costs. It has a portfolio of high-quality, low-carbon buildings that could house the bank at excellent commercial value. Leeds has offered the best value for money office space among the major European business cities for the past three years, according to Cushman and Wakefield\u2019s annual rankings, offering more competitive value than Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester, the other cities bidding for the bank. The region also has more buildings that are rated excellent by the Building Research Establishment environmental assessment method\u2014the world\u2019s leading design and assessment method for sustainable buildings\u2014than any of the other cities bidding.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/4\">Through existing organisations, the Leeds city region also already has the skill sets required to assess opportunities, make funding recommendations, save time and money on set-up costs and get the bank up and running as quickly as possible.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/5\">I want this to be a positive speech, but I have to put it on record that I, and other Members from the region, find it very frustrating that doubts have somehow been cast on some of those incredibly strong credentials of the Leeds city region. There are some strange misunderstandings, considering the very clear facts and the hugely strong case for the region. Some of us may feel that it is another example of something of a blind spot in parts of Westminster and Whitehall when it comes to our region. Perhaps we need to shout a little louder, and we shall. I hope that today, I have put the case forward and left little doubt in the minds of Ministers and others about the incredibly strong case for the region.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/6\">The Leeds city region and its surroundings have the specialist knowledge, skills, location and professional supply chain needed to support the green investment bank and its customers. As the House has heard, the potential for green investment in the Yorkshire and Humber region is huge, and the opportunity for the green investment bank in the Leeds city region is enormous.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/7\">The Minister knows that the green investment bank is hugely important for the UK, as a global leader on the environment, and the Leeds city region has the formula to make the bank deliver. As I said at the outset, the bank is an exciting and innovative vision, which I support, as I am sure do all right hon. and hon. Members who are in their places. We believe that it is an excellent fit with the innovation, expertise and infrastructure that already exists in the Leeds city region.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.672.0/8\">I know that the Government are serious about the green investment bank and the vision of what it can deliver towards a sustainable, greener economy. The message that I want to leave with the Minister, and with the team who will award a city the green investment bank, is that we in the Leeds city region are just as serious. We are serious not just about the bank being in Leeds, but about its succeeding, excelling and helping the UK to that more sustainable, greener economy.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Greg Mulholland", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356", "column": "", "time": "021:04:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.672.0", "house": "commons"}

Five of the UK\u2019s largest law firms and 150 accounting firms, including nine of the 10 largest UK practices, are based in the Leeds city region. Crucially, the professional and business services sector in the region has a strong record in supporting the delivery of low-carbon schemes. It is in demand for doing so across the UK, with a number of projects having been advised and structured by businesses from the Leeds city region. One example\u2014and we will provide more to the Minister\u2014which is from the other side of the Pennines, is the UK\u2019s largest wind farm on Scout moor in Manchester. Top legal teams based in Leeds, such as Addleshaw Goddard, regularly advise on international green projects, such as the latest power project in Saudi Arabia and a solar project in South Korea. This expertise and talent is already delivering what the green investment bank wants to do not just in the UK, but around the world.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.670.5/4\">Finally on talent, the region also has the necessary environmental expertise. The region\u2019s carbon capture and storage programme has been led by CO2Sense.

In April this year, the Leeds city region published a business survey which showed that, in respect of environmental innovation, 47% of businesses in the region reported that they had already taken significant action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

We have to accept that decarbonising the industrial and manufacturing sectors will be one of the green investment bank\u2019s biggest challenges. Our industrial past has left us with a huge challenge. Yorkshire and Humber as a whole is home to the UK\u2019s largest cluster of industrial CO2 emissions, equivalent to half the domestic emissions of the UK. Our three coal-fired power stations generate 17% of the UK\u2019s energy alone. Drax power station in the region is already co-firing with biomass in a bid to achieve its aim to generate 12.5% of its electricity in that way.

It has plans for three new dedicated biomass-fired plants, which would together add a further 900 MW to the UK\u2019s energy generation.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.667.6/6\">The Leeds city region is also at the forefront of the development of carbon capture and storage. The project under construction at Ferrybridge will provide the technical evidence needed to underpin large-scale demonstration plants across Europe. The Leeds city region is also leading the way on the delivery of domestic retrofit. Since the feed-in tariff subsidy began, Leeds has had the second biggest take-up of microgeneration technologies in the UK. It is second only\u2014this will certainly please <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644\" name=\"John Healey\">the right hon.

Friend the Member for Colne Valley mentioned Kirklees.

I would like to speak first to amendment (a) to Lords Amendment 29, under which the first as well as any subsequent regulations exempting certain providers from Ofsted inspection in particular circumstances would be subject to the affirmative procedure. The hon. Gentleman asked me particularly to address those matters.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.652.2/2\">My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097\" name=\"Nick Gibb\">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb)</phrase> has already spoken about a related amendment to the schools inspection exemption. The same intentions lay behind the exemption for further education providers and our plan, in essence, is to exempt outstanding colleges. I will listen, however, to the points raised. I do not have a dogmatic view on this matter, and as we move to a lighter-touch inspection regime, it is important to do so with appropriate caution.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.652.2/3\">I would like to deal with one particular concern. Where students feel that an outstanding institution is not maintaining high standards, Ofsted will take very seriously any comments students might make as part of the risk assessment, which could trigger an inspection. My hon. Friend the Minister spoke about the risk assessment process, and it is important that it is tied closely to the view of students about the quality of teaching and learning in an institution.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.652.2/4\">I spoke to the National Union of Students today about representation on college governing bodies, which we discussed when we dealt with the amendments to which the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby also referred. As I described earlier, we view such representation as a baseline. Representation on governing bodies does not provide the whole answer for learner or staff engagement. Learners and staff should be engaged at a policy level in plotting the strategic direction of a college. As we move to a more freed-up system, so learner choice and learner judgment will play an increasingly critical role in how colleges evolve. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the process. We are moving ahead boldly, but cautiously. At this juncture, it is probably best for me to leave that there.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.652.2/5\">Amendment (a) to Lords amendment 36 would require the chief executive of skills funding to make \u201cbest\u201d efforts rather than \u201creasonable\u201d efforts in respect of apprenticeships. Of course I understand the intention to strengthen the focus on the delivery of this important objective. It is crucial to maintain and, indeed, improve the quality of apprenticeships while we grow their number. When something grows rapidly, it obviously creates a pressure on quality. Inevitably, the momentum will lead to more employers and more providers becoming involved and more individuals becoming apprentices\u2014including people who might not have done so if the system was smaller. I believe that places an extra responsibility on us to ensure that the integrity of the brand is retained by an appropriate emphasis on quality, and as I said on the Floor of the House a few days ago in a different debate on a different subject, we will do that. The hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby is right to say that this amendment, and his argument about it, draws attention to the issue of quality.

I appreciate that there is a balance to be struck, and we very much welcome older workers having the opportunity to take up apprenticeships, but with youth unemployment almost certainly set to hit 1 million this week, we need to maintain the important focus on young people and the opportunity that is provided by having an apprenticeship place.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Stephen Twigg", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373", "column": "", "time": "020:15:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.650.1", "house": "commons"}

Other concerns, including those on information, advice, guidance and the careers service, are outside of the scope of today\u2019s debate. I should like to focus on inspection, governance and apprenticeships. I echo many of the things the Minister said, and in particular his positive comments on the role of the Association of Colleges, and I look forward to attending its conference in Birmingham later this week.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/4\">I also echo what <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119\" name=\"Andrew Percy\">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> said about the importance of partnerships between further education colleges and the wider education system, including schools. In the debate on the previous group, we discussed the importance of co-operation and collaboration alongside autonomy and competition. We often discuss school-to-school and college-to-college co-operation and collaboration, but there is great scope for further co-operation and collaboration between schools and the further education sector.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/5\">Let me address the inspection of further education institutions. All hon. Members are seeking to strike a balance between autonomy and inspection\u2014this is a similar debate to the one on schools, as the Minister said. Lords amendments 28 and 29 have much the same effect as Lords amendments 26 and 27. The former relate to further education institutions and the latter to schools.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/6\">The Opposition have a number of concerns that echo those we raised about schools, although they are not exactly the same. I should like briefly to put some of them on the record; they have been raised in previous stages both in this House and in the other place. We are concerned that exempting certain further education colleges from inspection will undermine the campaign for high standards in those institutions, and in particular we fear that the Government\u2019s approach is simply to rely on a market effect, which could let down, for example, students who are currently studying. Their institution could struggle and yet nothing will be done, and there is no trigger for them to make an inspection happen. It is possible\u2014we debated this with respect to schools\u2014for a further education institution that at one time was high performing to slip for some reason. The lack of an inspection regime in such a situation could be a major challenge.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/7\">The new Ofsted chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, was quoted in the previous debate by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148\" name=\"Kevin Brennan\">the Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase>. The chief executive\u2019s point was about schools, but it applies to further education colleges as well\u2014the principle is much the same. The conditions that would render a further education institution exempt from inspection are not clear. If the Minister has the opportunity, with the leave of the House later, I should like him to clarify the Government\u2019s thinking on when a further education college will be deemed exempt.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/8\">I understand that that thinking will be set out in regulations, but Lords amendments 28 and 29 mean that all regulations apart from the first set made under</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/9\">section (5) of the Education Act 2005 must be subject to the affirmative procedure. There is no requirement for an affirmative resolution the very first time the exemption criteria are outlined. I invite the Minister to explain his reasoning for that and to assure us that the measure is not simply being rushed through because of Ofsted\u2019s budget situation. Given the seriousness of the step that is being taken, and the lack of public consultation on it, the Opposition believe that there should be an affirmative resolution the first time as well as on subsequent occasions, and have tabled an amendment to that effect.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/10\">The Minister referred to issues of governance. As Lord Hill acknowledged on Report in the Lords, Labour peers, led by my noble Friend from the Labour Front Bench, Baroness Jones, made important arguments on this issue. Labour Front Benchers in the other place tabled an amendment to reinstate the rights of students and staff to be represented on further education colleges\u2019 governing bodies. As the Minister outlined, the Government brought forward an amendment on Third Reading in the other place to guarantee governing body places for staff and students. Lord Hill said:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/11\">\u201cIt may help if I inform noble Lords of discussions between the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, and my honourable friend, the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning\u201d\u2014</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/12\">the Minister\u2014on her amendment to</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/13\">\u201cretain requirements for staff and student governors\u2026The Government have brought forward these changes to support our case for the private sector classification for colleges, in accordance with the policy of successive Governments.

Participation in the governance of FE colleges is an important part of student citizenship, as well as contributing to good governance. I would like also to put on the record our appreciation to the National Union of Students for its excellent work on ensuring that the relevant amendments were agreed.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/18\">Nobody in this House could doubt the Minister\u2019s personal commitment to apprenticeships. We welcome the amendments that impose a duty on the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency to make reasonable efforts to secure employers\u2019 participation in apprenticeship training for all young people in the specified groups covered by the redefined offer\u2014that is, 16 to 18-year-olds and 19 to 24-year-olds with a disability or learning difficulty assessment, as well as young care leavers. Without those amendments, the Bill would have simply taken opportunities away from our young people. The Minister mentioned the assiduity of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40302\" name=\"Iain Wright\">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase> in Committee, where he said that the clause in question represented a wholesale degrading in the value the Government place on apprenticeships; that it is a retrospective step, stopping</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/19\">the duty to create apprenticeships for suitably qualified people; and that instead of creating jobs, transferring skills to young people, and boosting the economy, this clause does the exact opposite.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/20\">Lords amendment 36 is a significant improvement, but we believe that there is scope to go further. As the Minister has set out, under the legislation introduced by the previous Labour Government, the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency had a duty to secure an apprenticeship place for every suitably qualified person within certain specified categories. The previous Labour Government\u2019s policy was that the agency was under a duty to find an apprenticeship for every qualified young person who wanted one. They had to be given two choices about the sector that they wished to enter. That was removed in the original draft of the Bill, but as the Minister has said, a cross-party group of peers, led my noble Friend Lord Layard, achieved an important Government concession that required the agency to make reasonable efforts to involve employers in apprenticeship training, which has led to Lords amendment 36, which we welcome.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/21\">The amendment was a cross-party amendment, tabled in the names of Lord Layard, Lord Wakeham, Lord Willis of Knaresborough and Lord Sutherland. Lord Layard said in the other place:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.647.5/22\">\u201cIf you look at the situation in our country, it is clear that academic young people are offered a clear route to a skill and a useful role in society. They can see where they are going. That is not the case for less academic young people. There is no clear route that they can see they are entitled to go down. The result is low levels of skills and a degree of alienation\u2026If you look at this from a young person\u2019s point of view, we are raising the education participation age. It is quite difficult to see how we are going to be able to do that in a way that is acceptable to young people unless these apprenticeship places are available to them. We need legislation that states the main aims of our education system. For that 16 to 19 year-old group, we have a lacuna. We cannot fill it by ministerial statements and assurances, as Ministers come and go. We expect the basic structure of our educational system to be reflected in the laws of the country.\u201d\u2014[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-09-14\">14 September 2011</phrase>; Vol. 731, c.

Through our amendment (a) to Lords amendment 36, we would like to strengthen the slightly moderate language used in the Government\u2019s nevertheless important concession. My concern is about what will count as \u201creasonable efforts\u201d.

The new provisions cover what was afforded by previous legislation or Secretary of State directions.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/5\">As Members know, I am a keen advocate of freeing colleges from central prescription, direction and control. Such things inhibit a college\u2019s ability to become the master of its own destiny and stifle innovation and growth in our further education sector. The changes in the Bill will enable the Government to present the best case possible to encourage the Office for National Statistics to review its decision to reclassify colleges into the public sector. However, we are not merely responding to the ONS; we began this programme of reform long before we knew about the ONS reclassification. Indeed, it was one of the first things that I set out when I became a Minister. The changes that we have made in the Bill, including the ones that we have introduced at a later stage, are entirely in the spirit of the policy direction set out in the skills strategy which I published, following extensive consultation, last autumn. Indeed, they are in the spirit of the further consultation in which we were involved over the summer, which will lead to the publication of \u201cNew Challenges, New Chances\u201d.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/6\">The truth is that the ONS reclassification has been a further spur to us, but has not caused us to change direction. If anything, it has cemented our determination to consider every aspect of college management and every means by which we could free colleges from bureaucracy and direction. That fresh thinking has inspired the changes that have been made to the Bill.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/7\">As I have said, the changes, and our efforts to secure the private sector reclassification of colleges, have been welcomed, not least by the Association of Colleges. It considers that they will provide colleges with additional flexibility, allowing them to respond effectively to their local community and economy. I should like to place on record my gratitude to the Association of Colleges for its guidance and support, and indeed for how it has challenged us, in helping the Government develop this impressive legislation.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/8\">Lords amendments 28, 29 and 39 concern the business of colleges and inspection. You will remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, the report that the previous Government commissioned from Sir Andrew Foster. I have a copy of the summary here. They asked him to examine the potential of further education, and he concluded that the landscape that it faced was</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/9\">\u201ccrowded with organisations charged with inspection, improvement or regulatory functions. There is unnecessary complexity and duplication of effort and further rationalisation is required.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/10\">He also recognised, I think, that we needed to rethink how colleges were gauged, inspected and monitored. Knowing that we had some outstanding further education colleges in this country, we decided that the time was right to look afresh at inspection and regulation.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/11\">In that context, some of the comments that the Minister of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097\" name=\"Nick Gibb\">the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb)</phrase>, made about schools pertain to colleges too. He dealt with the issue of the inspection of schools earlier this evening, and some of the same principles apply to colleges. In my visits to colleges across the country, I have continually been impressed by the quality of teaching, the standard of learning and the innovative systems that colleges put in place to maximise learners\u2019 potential.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/12\">Lords amendments 28 to 30 provide for greater parliamentary scrutiny of regulations exempting further education colleges from inspections, by requiring that all regulations except the first set be subject to the affirmative procedure, so that both Houses can be assured that a full debate will happen before further colleges are exempted. We decided very early on that we wanted to limit the inspection of further education colleges, as we did in the case of schools. However, it is important that that exemption is qualified in the way that I have described. The Prime Minister spoke today of coasting schools, and nor do we want to see any coasting colleges. Although there is little evidence of them, it is important that the House can debate the matter as further exemptions take root.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/13\">I turn to Lords amendments 36, 43 and 100, which put the legal framework for apprenticeships on a more sustainable and realistic footing. I need not regale the House at length with how passionately I support apprenticeships\u2014at least, not for more than a few minutes. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have championed apprenticeships both in opposition and in government, and the Government have turned our rhetoric into action by delivering the biggest growth in apprenticeships in modern times. I have said before, and I am happy to say now, that there is more work to be done. As we make that growth sustainable, we will need to consider bureaucracy and the quality and age spread of apprenticeships. It is absolutely right that we should do that, but let us not understate the growth that we have</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/14\">seen\u201429% growth in under-19 apprenticeships and 64% growth in 19-to-24 apprenticeships over two years, and a big jump in post-25 apprenticeships.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.644.1/15\">It is important to say that the previous Government had the same aims. Many times, previous Ministers, including the previous Prime Minister, estimated the likely jump in the number of apprenticeships and the number that would be necessary to fill skills gaps. However, this Government are actually delivering. We are making more opportunities available to more people to add to their skills, which will increase their chances of getting, keeping and progressing in jobs. We know from independent research that someone who has a level 2 apprenticeship is likely to earn \u00a370,000 more over their earning lifetime than somebody who has not, and that somebody with a level 3 apprenticeship is likely to earn more than \u00a3100,000 more. That is roughly equivalent to a degree.</p>\n"], "speakername": "John Hayes", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547", "column": "", "time": "019:45:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.644.1", "house": "commons"}

Frankly, however, I have to say to my right hon. Friend, to whose assiduity, eloquence and wisdom I have previously paid tribute, that if the price of freedom is that loss of control, it is a price worth paying for the benefit it brings in the kind of innovation, exercise of imagination, responsiveness and dynamism to which I drew the House\u2019s attention earlier. That was certainly the view of the other place and, in general terms, the view of the Committee as we went through the Bill. There is growing cross-party acknowledgement that we can no longer predict and provide\u2014that we do indeed need to create a more responsive system. I say that because the character of our economy is changing. Economic need is increasingly dynamic, and a system that is controlled from the centre would never be sufficiently nimble to respond to that commercial need. That is now widely acknowledged. The difference is that we are going about this with purpose, energy and enthusiasm.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.642.0/2\">Let me return to staff and student representation. It is important that we see the statutory requirement that I have described merely as a baseline. There are all kinds of other good things that we can do in terms of staff and student representation, but representation on governing bodies, it was argued persuasively, should be a baseline. Lords amendment 51 extends those changes to institutions that are not college corporations, but that have been designated by legislation to receive public money for the provision of further education. It would come into effect should they decide to change their existing instruments and articles.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.642.0/3\">Lords amendments 50 and 58 give colleges the power to close themselves, which is known as dissolution. Currently, only the Secretary of State can dissolve a college. The amendments remove that power from the Secretary of State and give colleges control over their own dissolution. Colleges will also have the ability to transfer their property, rights and liabilities to another person or body for the purposes of education. These amendments and the regulations that will be laid in support of them include a number of safeguards to ensure that any dissolution decision is taken only when all those affected\u2014staff, students and the local community \u2014have been properly consulted, and that the process will be transparent, recognising that colleges are providers of an important public service.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.642.0/4\">In Committee, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40302\" name=\"Iain Wright\">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase>, who is not in his place, but who was a diligent member of the Committee, raised questions about the likelihood that colleges would fail with these new freedoms. There is no evidence to suggest that the extra freedoms will increase the risk of failure. Notwithstanding what I said about the growing understanding of the need to allow colleges to be more locally responsive, it is worrying that there are those who believe that colleges will not rise to the challenge of the new freedoms and who believe that only through central Government control can we give the necessary protection to the common interest, which I have no doubt was in the heart of the</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.642.0/5\">hon. Gentleman. I do not think that he is right. Colleges have shown time and again that when they are given the opportunity to be their best, unrestricted, they can be so.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.642.0/6\">I am keen to address that point in more detail in relation to the amendments. Further education is a high-performing sector, with more than 95% of colleges judged satisfactory or better. Sometimes further education has been treated as what Sir Andrew Foster described as the \u201cneglected middle child\u201d of education, somewhere between schools and higher education. I see it more as the prodigal son, and not just that, but the prodigal son grown up. I want further education to be a favoured part of our education system because of the difference it makes to so many lives. The important thing is to ensure that where problems occur, there are robust monitoring and support systems so that colleges are given the opportunity and help to recover. It is right that we have in place the proper protections from failure because, as I have described, public interest is involved. A great deal of taxpayers\u2019 money is involved too. However, we should not get to the point of creating an immense infrastructure to manage the college sector.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.642.0/7\">I think that it is correct to say, albeit with the benefit of hindsight, that after incorporation and the freedoms that colleges enjoyed as a result, we responded in a heavy handed way to the occasional, rare incidents of failure. It is reasonable to conclude that the advent and actuality of the Learning and Skills Council was an overreaction to the challenges associated with the new freedoms.</p>\n"], "speakername": "John Hayes", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547", "column": "", "time": "019:30:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.642.0", "house": "commons"}

We ought to declare that we share an interest in that topic and that we might have some personal interest in ensuring that there are sufficient craft skills to maintain our historic vehicles\u2014although his demands in those terms are considerably more numerous than mine.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/2\">The sector has welcomed the proposals to offer colleges more freedom. Colleges have long called for such an approach. In the long years that I spent in the shadows before the electorate elevated me to the light, I remember hearing from colleges across the country that they hoped, wished and longed for a Government who would recognise that power is best vested in the hands of those closest to where it is exercised. Colleges should be able to respond to their learners and employers in the way the Bill facilitates. It is therefore unsurprising that, in the public evidence sessions of the Bill, the Association of Colleges said in written evidence that the legislative requirements removed by the Bill,</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/3\">\u201cwill strengthen rather than diminish the historic community role of Colleges and strengthen the importance of strong governance\u201d.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/4\">I wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/5\">Lords amendments 47 to 71, changes which I recognise were made late in the Bill\u2019s passage through the other place, have been made in the context of a changed further education landscape. In October 2010, the Office for National Statistics announced its decision to reclassify FE colleges to the public sector for the purposes of the national accounts. That decision exposes colleges to the full rigours of the Government expenditure regime and means that they will lose the flexibility to phase expenditure between different financial years and that they will need to work within a financial year that does not line up with their academic year. Such a decision also makes it likely that the very freedoms that were introduced to enable them to borrow without seeking permission will need to be taken away from them, and that even tighter constraints will need to be introduced.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/6\">I would like to thank Baroness Sharp for raising those issues in the context of the sterling work she is doing as chair of the inquiry into colleges in their communities. In debating these important amendments, it is vital for me to emphasise the significance of the ONS decision. We were already well on the way to freeing the sector from some of the diktats, bureaucracy and unnecessary regulation that had so hampered and inhibited people from exercising their long-cherished desire to respond proactively to the interests of learners in the way I have described. Nevertheless, the ONS\u2019s reclassification has turned our desire into an imperative and we are working closely to try to persuade it to rethink that classification, because it will have profound effects on the FE sector. The late changes made in the other place, which we are debating for the first time in this House today, were made because of that ONS classification. Those and other controls would all act as significant barriers to college growth and would stifle innovation and creativity in our further education sector. As I said, it is our intention to make the necessary legislative and administrative changes to encourage the ONS to reclassify colleges back to the private sector which, as my noble friend Lord Hill said in the other place, is where successive Governments have wished them to be.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/7\">I want to mention the ability that Lords amendments 49, 58 and 69 will give colleges to modify or replace their instruments and articles of governance. In the world I have described\u2014the picture I have painted\u2014the additional freedoms that colleges will enjoy necessitate a new approach to governance. We need colleges to rise to the occasion. I am confident that they will, but it is partly a case of rethinking how colleges are governed. Colleges will continue to be required to comply with a statutory governance framework, but that has been significantly simplified to allow colleges the freedom to decide how best to shape their governance arrangements to meet the needs of their learners, employers and the local community.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/8\">May I say a word about the work that the Association of Colleges is doing in that regard? The association is working on a set of model instruments and articles that are framed in the new environment of greater discretion and freedom. There is immense human capital in colleges but, too often, it has been locked up because of the approach taken by previous Governments. There was a view that it was best to dictate, predict and provide from the centre. That is not this Government\u2019s view. For example, as a result of the amendments, colleges will no longer have to seek the Government\u2019s permission</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/9\">to add more members to their governing body or to determine whether a job vacancy should be advertised nationally.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.637.4/10\">Those are important aspects of a college\u2019s governance, but they are not things in which the state should be involved. The use of that power will not be compulsory. If colleges are content that their existing arrangements support them to meet the needs of local learners and employers, they will not have to change them. The benefit of the changes is that the decision over when and how colleges exercise those powers sits firmly with them. I mentioned that such measures have been welcomed by colleges themselves. They were, for the most part, also warmly welcomed in the other place.</p>\n"], "speakername": "John Hayes", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547", "column": "", "time": "019:03:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.637.4", "house": "commons"}

The persistence came, in particular, after we had asked the awarding organisations to check that there were no further errors. They did those checks and confirmed that there were none, but then further errors were discovered and damage was caused. That is an example of persistence in the errors we are trying to eliminate from the system.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/2\">The hon. Member for Cardiff West asked for an explanation regarding Lords amendments 89 to 91 about land. The Bill introduces new powers to transfer the publicly funded land of foundation and voluntary schools to free schools and academies when those schools close or the land is to be otherwise disposed of. Lords amendments 89 to 91 reduce the reach of those new powers so that they do not apply to land that is leased to a new academy by a private landlord. Where we are engaging in commercial negotiations with private landlords for the lease of land to new free schools, we think it is more appropriate to protect any public investment in that land by contractual means rather than in statute.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/3\">The hon. Gentleman also raised the PFI issue and I am happy to restate the purpose of amendment 34. Under section 6(2) of the Academies Act 2010, a local authority \u201cmust cease to maintain\u201d a school once it converts to academy status. Some banks and local authorities have asked whether that prohibition on maintenance might prevent a local authority from making a payment under PFI or other contracts. Our view is that local authorities have always been able to use their own resources to provide assistance, including financial assistance, to academies and to enter into contractual commitments and incur liabilities on their behalf. We are clear that section 6(2) of the Academies Act does not prevent the continuation of those activities. All academies are and will continue to be maintained by the Secretary of State under funding arrangements entered into under section 1 of the Academies Act, and any assistance provided by local authorities to academies, whether financial or otherwise, will only ever be a proportion of the total expense. Amendment 34 therefore confirms that local authorities can continue to make payments for academies under PFI and other contracts.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/4\">My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford and the hon. Member for Cardiff West raised the issue of direct payment pilots. The Minister of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40113\" name=\"Sarah Teather\">the Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather)</phrase>, who has responsibility for children and families, wrote to peers in the other place explaining the importance of introducing this new clause and consulted on the text of the draft clause, including in relation to special educational needs and disability organisations as well as local government interests. The principles behind the clause\u2014greater choice and control for the families of children with SEN\u2014are shared across the House. Indeed, the clause is modelled on legislation on the direct payment health pilots that were introduced by the previous Government. Let me reassure hon. Members that the orders needed to give practical effect to the clauses are subject to the affirmative procedure. These are, after all, powers concerning pilots rather than a national scheme and the clause has a sunset provision of four years.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/5\">My hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness asked about anyone being able to refer complaints to the adjudicator. We do not believe this change will lead to many more complaints. The regulations on which we are currently consulting will ensure that repetitive, vexatious or anonymous complaints cannot be made. I hope that will provide him with some reassurance. On the issue of spite, which he also raised, \u201canyone\u201d does mean anyone, so it could be a school or a charity. The only proviso is that they must be willing to put their name to objections and to refer matters that are new or substantially new to the adjudicator.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/6\">My hon. Friend asked about consistency in the referral of misconduct cases by schools to the regulator. Evidence suggests that there is already variation in referrals despite the blanket duty on employers to refer all cases, and this duty has not been affected. Employers will know when a case of misconduct is serious enough potentially to require a referral from the profession, and they can use the draft prohibition guidance, which I can send to my hon. Friend, to help them make this decision. If a member of the public is not happy with the decision, they can refer a complaint to the Secretary of State.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/7\">My hon. Friend also asked about Ofsted\u2019s capacity to deliver more rigorous assessments. We have discussed and agreed the more rigorous risk assessment, and Ofsted has the resources necessary within its budget to achieve this. Every organisation has to prioritise its resources in the current economic climate and Ofsted is no different.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/8\">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford for his continued and vocal support for academies and free schools. I assure him that it is right that admissions at academies and free schools must comply with the admissions code as set out in their funding agreements. As with all other state-funded schools, complaints about admissions will now go to the adjudicator.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/9\">My hon. Friend also raised concerns about particular families who do not adopt personal budgets\u2014one third is the figure he cited\u2014and the support they require. He argues for having pilots, and that is what the new clause does. I share his concerns about the possible burdens on families. That is why the pilots will look at the support available to families and how the system can be as straightforward as possible to use, as well as at which families take up those payments and which do not. On the point that the hon. Member for Cardiff West made, cost-cutting is not a driver for this policy\u2014it is about having greater choice and control.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/10\">On the issue of Ofqual and how the Conservatives could support a regime of fining by a regulator, my hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire set out the reasons why the qualifications market needs to be regulated. I should like to make it clear that turnover will be determined in accordance with an order made by the Secretary of State and that Ofqual will consult on how the fining regime is to operate.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/11\">I listened carefully to the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Bedford and for Stevenage about primary schools. Primary national offer day will be <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-04-16\">16 April</phrase>. The idea is to co-ordinate the date rather than to put any new pressure on parents to get their children into certain primary schools. It merely makes things easier and less stressful for parents rather than more stressful.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/12\">Let me deal briefly with some of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Cardiff West. He will know that we have listened carefully to the concerns expressed in this House and in the other place in response to our original intention to withdraw schools and colleges from the duty to co-operate. The evidence of that engagement is clear in these Lords amendments. We have removed the \u201cduty to co-operate\u201d clause as well as the clause that the hon. Gentleman seeks to amend regarding the children and young people\u2019s plan.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.629.1/13\">The hon. Gentleman\u2019s amendment (a) to Lords amendment 23 relates to our plans to allow anyone to refer an objection to the schools adjudicator about the admissions arrangements at any state-funded school in the country. The amendment would require admissions authorities and others to comply with the adjudicator\u2019s decision within 14 days of receiving written notice of that decision. Current legislation in this area, which was introduced by the Labour party, requires compliance to be forthwith. Let me assure the House once more that our changes to admissions do not affect the adjudicator\u2019s power to consider and decide on the matter put to him and other matters as he sees fit, or to make binding decisions as a consequence. The amendment would impose a stringent national timetable for the implementation of such decisions. It is based on two false assumptions\u2014first that schools do not wish to put things right, which they do, and secondly that all situations are the same, which they are not. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a Division.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Nick Gibb", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097", "column": "", "time": "018:45:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.629.1", "house": "commons"}

There will be a column for children who achieve level 5 at key stage 2, and another column for those who achieve level 3 at key stage 2.

That will help to identify those schools that are coasting, and we will then take action against those schools or help them to improve their results.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.627.3/3\">The hon. Member for Cardiff West also talked about triggers for inspections. That is a matter for Her Majesty\u2019s chief inspector, but I can confirm that there will be annual risk assessment for outstanding schools, which will normally commence three years after the last inspection. Where there is a change of head teacher before that point, however, the chief inspector has agreed to bring forward the risk assessment, including an HMI review. Ultimately, however, we have to leave it to the professional judgment of the inspector to determine whether an inspection should be triggered. Factors to be taken into account might include: a school\u2019s performance data that had previously been judged to be less than outstanding in achievement or teaching not showing signs of improvement since its last inspection; progress measures showing that pupils or students were not making good progress in comparison with similar groups nationally; or below-average attendances showing little sign of improvement. Many factors can act as a trigger for an inspection.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.627.3/4\">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of admissions. I thank him for his attention to detail in scrutinising the codes, but I can assure him that they are statutory. \u201cMust\u201d means \u201cmust\u201d in those codes; they have the full force of the law.

I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart), for Bedford (Richard Fuller), for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss), for Stroud (Neil Carmichael), for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) and for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland) for their thoughtful contributions, and I shall respond to as many of their points as possible, in addition to speaking to the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) and for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan).</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.626.0/2\">The hon. Member for Cardiff West asked me to say a little more about Lords amendments 1 to 4, which relate to interim prohibition orders. Since the Bill\u2019s introduction, it has included a new power for the Secretary of State to make such orders. Many regulators have a power of that kind for use in the rare cases when it is in the public interest to bar an individual while an investigation is under way, prior to a final decision being made. When the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee scrutinised the Bill, it asked about the safeguards that were going to be put in place. As a matter of policy, we intended the issue of interim suspension orders to be possible only when it was in the public interest, and subject to regular six-monthly reviews when requested. The Committee suggested that those quality safeguards be placed on the face of the Bill. The amendments were debated briefly in Grand Committee before being made in the other place.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.626.0/3\">On extending teacher anonymity, we have to proceed on the basis of evidence in restricting press freedom. I have already cited the findings of our survey. Teachers are much more likely to be the subject of allegations than other staff in schools. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the teachers of 16 to 19-year-olds in further education colleges, but the evidence from the survey shows that just 1% of allegations related to teachers in FE colleges, compared with 23% relating to school teachers. The NASUWT\u2019s records show that, in the past 10 complete years, it has provided a solicitor in relation to 1,592 cases of allegations against teachers, of which 1,439 resulted in no further action being taken.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.626.0/4\">The survey related to local authority designated officers\u2014LADOs\u2014and the total number of allegations of abuse that were referred to LADOs in the 116 local authorities that responded to the survey was 12,086, of which 2,827, or 23%, related to teachers. Of those, allegations of abuse related to 0.6% of the teaching profession as a whole. That means that there are 1.5 times as many allegations against teachers as against support staff, which had a figure of 0.4% of the total non-teaching population.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.626.0/5\">On the basis of that survey, I believe that we have got this measure right. I say with all due respect to my hon. Friends that we must not let the best become the enemy of the good. I have heard Members on all sides of the debate today pushing to extend the measure to more staff, and not to extend it to teachers because of the effect that it has on them, but I think that we have got it just about right.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.626.0/6\">The hon.

Friend, because reputational risk is very important. The problem is simply that it comes back to reputational risk and the nuclear option, as many awarding organisations can take a chance and build into their business models the number of mistakes they can make before they appear in national headlines. I am not saying that that is what they are doing, but with Ofqual\u2019s current position there is a very odd situation in which the awarding organisations can identify the relationship they want with the regulator, rather than the regulator regulating the industry.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.625.0/2\">Providing Ofqual with the ability to fine awarding organisations at 10% allows it to say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t comply and engage with us, we can fine you up to 10%.\u201d I agree with the Minister that there will no doubt be a sliding scale and that it will be introduced with consultation, but the key point, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40227\" name=\"Damian Hinds\">the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)</phrase> noted earlier, relates to the Japanese example of smashing one circuit in 1,000 to ensure that they comply. We do not want one mistake to ensure that Ofqual and the awarding organisations comply with one another; we want them to have a relationship based on trust and understanding and, as a last resort, for there to be the threat of fine if the awarding organisations do not engage with Ofqual. Reputational risk is important, but I think that we all understand that what affects people ultimately is the bottom line: what profit they are making and how they are engaging. That is what is important, because that is what they are employed to do. I broadly agree with the Ofqual situation. There is a bit of conflict, because it means giving a quango more powers, but in this situation I think that that is correct.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.625.0/3\">We also had a robust and prolonged debate on Ofsted, with many interventions. There was a suggestion that some schools would not be inspected for perhaps 10, 15 or 20 years, but in practice that is unrealistic. I was under the impression that when a new head teacher took over a school, particularly a primary school, traditionally that would trigger an Ofsted inspection within a couple of years. I understand that under the Bill\u2019s provisions Her Majesty\u2019s chief inspector of schools will trial a new approach so that, when a new head teacher takes over, the inspector will contact the school to discuss the performance and the head teacher\u2019s plans for the future, which I think is a much more effective way of working with outstanding schools.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.625.0/4\">Triggers have been mentioned. I understand that there will be a guaranteed minimum re-inspection rate of 5% and that governors, through the powers and freedoms we are allowing them\u2014<phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40430\" name=\"Dan Rogerson\">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> spoke effectively about this in Committee on several occasions\u2014will be able to say that they are losing confidence in how things are going. If parent governors in our constituencies believe that children are not getting access to the best education, they phone their MP or local authority straight away to demand the best for their children. That would also</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.625.0/5\">ensure that those schools will have the best from the new freedom to engage and not to be inspected every couple of years.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.625.0/6\">On a wider note, I am pleased that Ofsted will no longer give six or seven weeks\u2019 notice of inspections. The notice period had meant that teaches would often work for 15 or 16 hours a day for six or seven weeks, including weekends, to try to ensure that their school is seen at its best. I do not believe that that is the best way of conducting inspections. What Ofsted is doing at the moment is giving a couple of days\u2019 notice before turning up, which provides a much better reflection of the school. As the years go by, that will provide a much better snapshot of what is happening.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.625.0/7\">Also, the freedoms for academies in the Bill will lift education across every constituency and local education authority area. Competition is the wrong word to use in a debate on education, but those schools, head teachers and teachers will be seeking to attract the best children.

Like my hon. Friend the Members for Bedford (Richard Fuller) and for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart), the Chairman of the Select Committee, who is not at present in his place, I broadly support the amendments but would like to push the Government to go a little further in some respects. One of my key themes is that the Bill seems to be written very much with secondary schools in mind, as opposed to primary schools. Although there are some elements of the Bill that focus on primary schools, it could go much further.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/2\">Members in all parts of the House have welcomed the fact that teachers will have anonymity from false accusations. If the individual is charged, the police will not be prevented from investigating, but the teacher will be protected. That is good news, but Members on all sides are concerned that it does not go far enough. One of my worries is that in a primary school setting, where teaching assistants are often given responsibility for dealing with the most difficult children, sometimes the most difficult families, and work in a room with just one or two of those children, they are at severe risk from such accusations.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/3\">I welcome the amendments from another place relating to an application in a court for a judge to lift reporting restrictions. The welfare of the teacher who is the subject of the allegation is taken into account, as is the welfare of the pupil or pupils who are the alleged victims. However, the Government could go a little further and think about staff in specific situations. For example, I know of schools around the country where teaching assistants are often put in charge of classrooms, essentially acting as teachers. Under the Bill, they will not have the same protection as a teacher in the next classroom who is dealing with the same key stage group. I urge the Government to look into such situations and respond accordingly.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/4\">On the admissions code, I welcome many of the changes, particularly the fact that adopted children who were looked after before they were adopted will still have the same priority for places as looked-after children. That is extremely important, as it could benefit 3,000 children each year. I have an example in my constituency of a child who was adopted for many of the best reasons\u2014I know that across all parties there is a big push to ensure that children are adopted much faster, instead of being looked after\u2014yet simply because they did not remain a looked-after child, 17 different funding streams that had been providing support within the school were lost.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/5\">From an educational point of view, it might seem that it would have been in the child\u2019s interest to continue to be looked after, as opposed to being adopted, whereas from the point of view of their social development, it is much better for the child to have been adopted and become part of a more stable family. I welcome the provision, which is important in setting a precedent for considering in the round the priorities in such a situation. Those children still have the same problems securing a place in a school that is right for them, and it is important for the family who have adopted the child to be given access to the necessary services.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/6\">I note that there is to be a national offer day for primary schools and I welcome it, but with some trepidation. It was recommended that it would be on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-03-01\">1 March</phrase> and be similar to what parents are used to for secondary schools. I welcome the proposal, but I worry that many parents might put pressure on their children at age three or four in the way many do when their children are 10 or 11. I would like to hear a little more from the Minister on how the national offer day for primary schools would work, because it is something that interests me and a large number of my constituents. The reason behind it is that there are different dates by which children are admitted to primary schools in different local authorities, which can cause great confusion for parents. I know from my constituency postbag that often a large number of parents are concerned that they cannot get their children into the nearest one of two schools simply because they have missed the date by which they were to apply for admission. I welcome the proposal, but I would like to know a little more about how it will work in practice.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/7\">We had a robust debate on Ofqual, which was fascinating to listen to.

Friend the</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/8\">Member for Bedford looks up sharply\u2014because I am concerned that awarding organisations regard Ofqual as having no teeth. Much of the focus was on the fact that there were 12 or 13 mistakes in exam papers this year, which affected 140,000 children, creating great confusion for them, their families and their teachers. That can be heartbreaking, because it is not the child\u2019s fault.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.622.0/9\">I mentioned in an intervention the possibility of legal insurance offsetting some of the costs, but the Conservative in me is concerned about giving another quango more powers to intervene. I am conflicted on the amendment, but I will support it because on the whole I believe that it is important that regulators have teeth. When we look at the size of some of the awarding organisations, we see that the largest has a turnover of \u00a3250 million, and the assessment market is worth \u00a31 billion, so we must have some kind of control over it.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Stephen McPartland", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40576", "column": "", "time": "018:15:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.622.0", "house": "commons"}

Well, coalition government is an analogue process as well, and my noble Friends, along with Lord Laming, were keen that the issue, especially with regard to safeguarding, should remain on the statute book, because of the emerging relationship between local authorities and schools that will follow the transition in some parts of the country when large schools to take up the opportunities of the academies programme. The Secretary of State for Education has spoken in the past about the need to consider how local authorities and schools will work in that context.

Clearly, the Secretary of State has that duty, supported by the schools adjudicator, so that should set minds at rest. Where there have been anomalies, some are anecdotal. We hear, for example, that in the original academies lower numbers of pupils were on free school meals than at other schools in the area. That requires exploration. The pupil premium will have the effect of showing that all schools will benefit hugely from bringing in pupils from across the community and having the resources to provide any extra support that might be necessary early on in a student\u2019s school career, to ensure that they get the benefit that everybody else enjoys as they move through the education system.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.620.0/6\">I am grateful to the Minister and his noble Friend for the changes that they have made to the original proposals on school governance.

In an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, who chairs the Committee on which I serve, I wondered what level of defect the Japanese would look for. I specifically picked Japan, rather than Shanghai, Finland or any of the popular examples because of my experience of joining the Manchester and Merseyside branch of IBM as a tender 17-year-old. The story new starters were told might have been apocryphal, but it was that that IBM specified a 99.99% success rate in the contract with its Japanese microchip supplier. The Japanese were a bit confused, but dutifully smashed one in every 10,000 chips to ensure that they complied with the rate. The point is that other systems do things better than ours does and that people with other systems accept nothing but the best. Following that experience, IBM adopted the principle that is known in business as zero defects.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Damian Hinds", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40227", "column": "", "time": "018:00:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.618.3", "house": "commons"}

The Government will not use CVA\u2014and thank God for that; I have yet to meet anyone who understands it. I have served on the Education Committee for 18 months and we are still waiting for our first teacher, head teacher, pupil, local authority officer or anyone else from the education establishment to talk voluntarily about CVA as a measure of school performance. Instead, we have what most people would understand as a value-added measure\u2014progress from key stage 2 to key stage 4\u2014which will do most of that job without the extra complexity and formulaic high jinks that the contextual bit introduces.

Many of the indicators are what we might call \u201cdigital indicators\u201d, but Ofsted produces an analogue report with much richer evaluation and comment than some of those measures. I am sure that many parents will want to know that there is a relatively recent report informing them about some of the things that they cannot necessarily read in league tables, but I do not think that any of that calls necessarily for the formulaic approach of automatic triggers that Labour Members suggest.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.618.1/5\">The next area I want to touch on is the anonymity of teachers.

I wish to start where my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40590\" name=\"Neil Carmichael\">the Member for Stroud (Neil Carmichael)</phrase> so eloquently left off: on the duty to co-operate. I agree wholeheartedly that we should celebrate co-operation, teamwork, playing to strengths and so on. I accept that the Government think it necessary to retain the duty to co-operate, as was, but I hope the Minister will agree that it is not always best to systematise and design processes; free co-operation can frequently be more effective.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.617.0/2\">In a different but closely connected arena, the Select Committee, on which I sit and of which my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076\" name=\"Graham Stuart\">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase> is Chair, is examining the broader issue of child protection. In that area, the number of flow charts, systems, fall-back plans and required times by which something must happen provide what appears to be a very impressive system, but in many ways more questions are created than are answered.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.617.0/3\">There is much to be gained from schools co-operating, so that we get more than the sum of the parts. The education improvement partnership in my constituency brings together all 44 schools\u2014nobody forced them, and it was not the result of any duty\u2014to work on a range of things, including the gifted and talented programmes; the provision of pupil referral units; nurture for primary children at risk of exclusion; and training for emotional literacy support assistants. That makes the biggest difference.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.617.0/4\">The second thing I wish to talk about is Ofsted, outstanding schools and triggers. I accept that there is an honest and reasonable difference between the parties on this, which reflects a difference that we see on lots of subjects. Labour Members would like codified exactly what will trigger the re-inspection of a school previously judged to be outstanding, whereas Ministers are keen to think of a range of things that might make that happen but do not wish to be quite so specific and accept that, to an extent, the system is organic. The Select Committee closely examined whether a change of head should automatically trigger a re-inspection. I think that there is a strong argument to say that such a big personnel change, perhaps when combined with one or two other changes, might be a good reason for so doing, but there might be counterbalancing arguments against.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Damian Hinds", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40227", "column": "", "time": "018:00:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.617.0", "house": "commons"}

Several years might elapse before an inspection, but I do not believe that we are talking of decades.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/2\">We must bear it in mind that there are other accountability mechanisms: the choice that parents make; the measurements that league tables offer; and the role of governors. I know that <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148\" name=\"Kevin Brennan\">the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> is not going to press the issue to a Division, but I consider it very important, and I think that the Government are right to be less prescriptive</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/3\">than they have been in the past. It is critical that we focus on what governing bodies should be, and on the role that they should have.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/4\">I have been involved in the establishment of an all-party parliamentary group on school governors, because I think that the issue has been overlooked for far too long. One of the key themes that the APPG is developing is the need to focus on skills rather than representatives of governing bodies, and it is reflected in both the Bill and the amendment. It is obvious to me, and, I believe, to most people\u2014it was certainly obvious to all who were involved in the formation of the APPG\u2014that a great many skills are required. It is a good idea to ensure that a local authority appoints a governor in consultation with the governing body, so that together they can come up with the right person to fill the skills gap. The school will then have a governing body that reflects its priorities and has the appropriate skills. I am glad that the Bill mentions the crucial role of governors, on whom I think we should turn the spotlight when we think about accountability.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/5\">That brings me to the question of reporting restrictions. Over 20 years, I have been involved in situations in which members of the teaching profession have had to undergo disciplinary procedures. Ironically, none has been connected with pupils, and I am pleased about that, but I could have done with a few reporting restrictions in one instance in particular. It is very difficult to manage such situations when they are being second-guessed by the press, which may investigate or discuss them in ways that are not helpful to the requirement that evidence is presented fairly and honourably so that people who are not involved in a case can make proper judgments and reach an unbiased conclusion. I discovered that if someone wants to get something published, they should simply mark it \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d and away it will go. It is right that the Bill examines this issue, because we have to ensure that our processes can be properly managed and controlled so that investigations can be undertaken and judgments made consistent with justice and good practice.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/6\">Finally, I wish to talk about the key duty to co-operate. In the Localism Bill the Government readily accept that authorities should co-operate with each other on a wide range of subjects. That is the right approach, because planning decisions, highway construction and so on are more effective when people co-operate, and the same applies to local authorities. To be consistent, the same must apply in dealing with schools and local authorities, although perhaps we need to be even more focused on the need to co-operate because schools benefit from co-operating on a host of things. As we move towards academies, free schools and choice, we should talk not about a federal structure for schools but about encouraging feeder schools to get more involved with secondary schools and providing similar support for special educational needs. As the shadow Minister rightly noted, the key is to think about pupils and their best interests. We should try to engineer a system under which there is an overall desire to co-operate, where co-operation takes place and where schools feel comfortable co-operating with each other. In broad terms\u2014and in absolute terms, because I cannot think of any criticism I am really making here\u2014I support the amendments, as the Government have expressed them.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/7\">I wish to emphasise some key points. First, we need to acknowledge and celebrate the work of governors and the importance of school governance. If we get that right, accountability will be appropriate and understood, and parents will feel increasingly comfortable with the overall structure of school leadership and management.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.615.1/8\">I have not mentioned the second point, but it is crucial. When money starts to go to schools not necessarily through local authorities but directly from the Department for Education, we will have an even more flexible, fluid way of dealing with schools that will produce excellent schools. But we can never take our foot off the accelerator in the drive to ensure that all our schools do the best they can for their pupils and that their pupils thrive. That is our message, and that is what we must do. The Bill will go a long way towards helping that to happen.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Neil Carmichael", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40590", "column": "", "time": "017:45:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.615.1", "house": "commons"}

There must be no mistakes in the preparation of exams.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.614.1/4\">The real problem, it seems to me, is that we have far too many examination boards, and I believe that the Education Committee will consider that in due course. We need accurate examinations so that students can feel confident that they are taking tests that are fair, proper and competent, and fines should be applied when those priorities are not honoured.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.614.1/5\">There is the important question of whether Ofsted should inspect outstanding schools. We must ensure that it concentrates on schools that are failing or coasting: as the Prime Minister rightly says, we must never fail to recognise that some schools are not doing a good enough job at present, and that they require our full attention. An Ofsted report is, of course, a snapshot of the situation that the Ofsted inspectors found during their visit, and is likely to convey contradictory messages. What I frequently find in my constituency, and certainly found when I was involved in education as a governor, is that such reports may not tell the story that other statistical evidence might tell.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.614.1/6\">I raised the problem when the Education Committee was considering Ofsted and its future. I asked witnesses what should be done when a school that is able to brandish very good exam results\u2014five passes graded between A-star and C\u2014receives an Ofsted report that tells a different tale. I know of two schools in my constituency that have been able to counter one bit of evidence with another, and both cases involved Ofsted reports. I therefore think that the Government are right to use the tool of Ofsted to focus more on the schools that are failing or coasting.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.614.1/7\">There are many different ways of measuring performance. We must enable parents to see, from year to year, that things are moving in the right direction in the schools that they choose\u2014or may choose in the future\u2014for their children.

Two thirds might well accept it, but that does not mean that the administrative problems and complexities will not have made their lives more complicated.

They wanted to make sure that Ministers understood the complexities of handling different panels, facing different options on statementing and having to look for disability living allowance, carer\u2019s allowance and so forth. Those are costs placed on individuals. Two thirds might well say, \u201cThis is what we want to do\u201d. That, however, with respect to the Minister, is not the point.

Those criticisms, from those organisations, have often flown in the face of the facts. Those facts show that admissions policies have often been just cut and pasted from other local schools. These Lords amendments will give reassurance on those criticisms, so that the reformist voices on the Opposition Benches can be encouraged further to recognise that there is a path forward and that this can be part of the most reforming legislation for some of the most disadvantaged children in our country. Therefore, Lords amendments 20 and 21 are most welcome.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.612.3/3\">I would like to talk about some of the comments made about direct, individual budgets for children with special educational needs, a topic of great interest in Committee when it came to ensuring that the reforms moved forward the provision of education for some of the most vulnerable children and young adults in our communities. Although in principle I am a supporter of individual budgets, both in this area and in others, I am somewhat sceptical about full implementation. It is interesting to note two parts of what Lord Hill said in the debate on the amendments dealing with personal budgets in the other place, when he referred, first, to</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.612.3/4\">\u201ccontrol over the support they receive and better access to and greater satisfaction with services.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.612.3/5\">I want to return to better access later.

I welcome the fact that in their lordships\u2019 overall assessment, the main thrust of the Bill should pass through to Royal Assent. It is most welcome that the core objectives of what the Government are trying to achieve will make it into law. That will be welcomed in rural constituencies, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560\" name=\"Elizabeth Truss\">the Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase> mentioned, and in others. However, the Lords have made some suggestions, which my hon. Friend the Minister indicated that the Government would support. I would like to draw his attention to a couple of those suggestions with which I concur wholeheartedly, and others with which I concur partly.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.610.0/2\">My first point is about the Lords\u2019 reinstatement of the duty on schools to co-operate with local authorities, which is specifically related to the well-being of children. That relates to the broader issue of how the new schools that are envisaged, and the ones that are already in place across the country, will co-operate with local authorities. Much attention has been given in the Bill\u2019s earlier stages in the Commons to the responsibilities of schools with regard to local authorities, but as my hon. Friend the Minister knows, I often look at the matter through the other end of the lens and ask what is the responsibility of the local authority to co-operate with our schools.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.610.0/3\">I, and I think many Government Members, hoped that when the noble Lords considered that duty to co-operate, they might send the Bill back to this House with amendments that were somewhat more creative than simply placing into the Bill the original duty as it already stands.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.610.0/4\">Throughout our country, we are seeing a radical change in the relationship between local authorities and schools. Schools are gathering greater freedoms to operate independently. Those relate to not only financial status, but areas of operations, one of the most important being admissions policies, which I will come to. That liberalisation of the market for schools\u2014if I can call it a market for schools\u2014is very welcome, but as a consequence of those freedoms, new issues come up, such as how schools work together on behalf of their local community, and how in doing so, both as individual schools, in pyramids of schools or chain academies, they interact with local authorities, which are the democratically elected bodies in those areas.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.610.0/5\">In many cases, those relationships have been conducted positively in the past, but there is sometimes a contradiction between the schools\u2019 best interests and those of local authorities. In that respect, it is a shame that the noble Lords have not sought to move the debate on the duty to co-operate forward to take us to the next stage of understanding. When the control over the education of our children is in the hands of such independent bodies, what will be the duty to co-operate between local authorities and schools?</p>\n"], "speakername": "Richard Fuller", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067", "column": "", "time": "017:30:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.610.0", "house": "commons"}

There have been many examples of innovation in my constituency in which schools have co-operated to provide a better service across disparate and sparse rural areas. Methwold high school in my constituency operates a vertically integrated model with Hockwold primary school. It has been able to save on administration costs and to run the school more efficiently. It offers GCSEs in subjects such as maths to local adults, thereby lowering its costs and offering a wider service. It also collaborates with further education and higher education establishments to offer local people degrees and other qualifications that they would not normally be able to access in such a remote area.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.609.0/3\">Another school in my constituency, Swaffham Hamond\u2019s high school, was regrettably unable to continue to offer A-levels last year due to the lack of local demand. Unfortunately, students from that school were obliged to travel for up to 45 minutes on local buses to go to King\u2019s Lynn to study their A-level choices. Since then, a local collaboration programme has been developed with Dereham school, which has been able to offer its A-levels at Swaffham Hamond\u2019s, ensuring that specialist teaching staff are used in the best way possible.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.609.0/4\">The raw economics of life in a very sparsely populated area mean that it is often more efficient and effective for specialist teachers to travel between schools than for students to travel vast distances from one school to another. That is what the head teachers of Swaffham and Dereham have achieved. They have ensured that the best sixth-form provision is available across a network of rural schools. That was a highly rational decision, but to get to the point of being able to offer that service they had to go through a whole load of bureaucracy. I know that the county council was involved in trying to sort that out, but ultimately the school from Dereham that offered its provision to Swaffham, a good 20-minute drive away, had to take a huge risk due to how the Young People\u2019s Learning Agency funding worked. A very innovative offering was available in a rural area, but schools struggled to put it in place because the funding models were more suited to large conurbations.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.609.0/5\">I am a huge supporter of academies and free schools, and I was very grateful to the Secretary of State for visiting Thetford academy, in my constituency, a couple of weeks ago. At present, however, the model delivers better for larger conurbations than for disparate areas. We need to find a way of making the funding more flexible, so that it can apply in remote rural areas and so that there is some pressure on failure and success in areas where it is very difficult for students to travel a long distance to a different school. We need to find a way of ensuring that failures are dealt with quickly and that success is rewarded, so that bad provision can be replaced and good provision can expand not just within a geographical location but elsewhere locally.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.609.0/6\">Norfolk schools are showing how collaboration should be done, but we need a way in which competition and collaboration can work alongside each other to ensure that we get the best economic models, that we use our teaching resources in the best possible ways and that we see innovation within the current environment.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Elizabeth Truss", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560", "column": "", "time": "017:15:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.609.0", "house": "commons"}

In all contexts, whenever anyone suggests that having insurance somehow means that there is not a problem, it usually means that there is a broad raising of costs across the piece, which is something that we should minimise. One of the changes that was made in the Lords and has now come before us recognises that some education awarding bodies are part of educational companies globally, that there should be a cap on how much they can be fined, and that that cap should be relevant to the amount of business that that organisation does in this country rather than in global operations. That is welcome.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/2\">We now have a repeal of the repeal of the duty to co-operate. The shadow Minister was right to say that we are glad to hear confirmation that this partnership working can continue. I am also glad to hear from the Minister, citing his noble Friend Lord Hill, that the Government are committed to that form of partnership. In all the high-profile cases, and others, of children who are found to be neglected, it turns out that people at the agencies have not talked to each other, and we need to ensure that they do. It may be possible that a particular duty to co-operate in a certain way leads to a mechanistic response. If there is another way of framing the whole conversation that encourages it without there being a bureaucratic or legislative solution, that is something that I would be open to, but until we have a convincing argument as to how the overall picture will work, it is a good thing that schools co-operate with the other bodies.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/3\">On admissions, we have the change whereby anyone can refer a case to the regulator. I assume that the impact assessment has taken account of this, but I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on that. If anyone can refer to the regulator on admissions, how many more referrals do we expect? If other hon. Members\u2019 caseloads are anything like mine, they will know that an awful lot of parents are concerned about admission arrangements and many of them go through the appeals process. I wonder how many would seek to question and make complaints to the admissions regulator using the power in the Bill.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/4\">Again referring back to the remarks of the shadow Minister, can the Minister give the House a reassurance on the time frame for an admissions body to correct itself? Is it really possible that we could have a 10-month delay? One of the dangers in this place is that so many Members are so high-minded. The Minister is one of the most high-minded, and there is a tendency to assume that all others in the system share his ethics, commitment and fairness. Perhaps I have led the wrong life, but I have met many people who are capable of spite. It would seem to me a mistake to have a system that allowed somebody who had appealed and won to be thwarted in an act of spite by a school because it could use the rules to avoid acting in time to provide justice to the person who had brought the complaint.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/5\">On Ofsted inspections, as I said earlier, I welcome the Government\u2019s proportionate approach. I would be grateful if the Minister talked us through the implications of the reduction in Ofsted\u2019s budget. Perhaps surprisingly for some Government Members, the previous Government brought in pretty strong reductions in Ofsted\u2019s budget. It is greatly to the credit of the then chief inspector that Ofsted coped with that without a discernible drop in quality. The budget is now going down even further\u2014from well over \u00a3200 million, it is dropping to about \u00a3143 million, from memory. I am interested to know how that will impact on Ofsted\u2019s ability to provide inspections.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/6\">The noble Lord Hill said in the other place that 72 outstanding schools had had inspections triggered by Ofsted\u2019s risk assessment process. That meant that about 2% of outstanding schools had been inspected in the period. He said that it had been agreed with Ofsted that the aim should be to inspect at least 5% of outstanding schools. I wonder how able Ofsted will be to deliver that 250% increase in workload just in the area of outstanding schools.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/7\">In winding-up, the Minister might also like to comment on primary schools, because all schools are not the same. It has always been of concern to me, when talking about greater autonomy and academies, that primary schools are fundamentally more fragile than secondaries. The departure of a head or a chair of governors, both of whom might contribute to a school being outstanding, can lead very quickly to a school\u2019s standards falling. I would like a reassurance that there are different approaches for primaries and secondaries, for example in the speed of reaction and the attention given to certain factors, such as a change of head at a primary school being given greater weight and being seen as more of a trigger to get Ofsted to come in and check that all is well.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.607.3/8\">With those remarks, I will leave it there.

We therefore welcome the extension of the code to academies and the clarification of that by the Government, rather than relying on funding agreements in order to achieve that.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/2\">One of the innovations of the Bill that we debated is the change to the powers of the schools adjudicator. Currently, when an admissions authority is found to be in breach of the code, the adjudicator can rectify any flaws with immediate effect, but following the passage of the Bill, the adjudicator will be able to make only \u201cbinding\u201d decisions, which the admissions authority will be obliged to implement. Ministers have already made it clear that the purpose of that change is to emphasise the importance of schools taking responsibility for their own actions, but it should not allow them the scope to avoid those responsibilities or to frustrate parents who have made a successful complaint and have a legitimate expectation that matters will be put right promptly.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/3\">The draft version of the admissions code was pretty clear. Paragraph 3.1 stated:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/4\">\u201cThe admission authority must revise their admission arrangements immediately to give effect to the Adjudicator\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/5\">That was the original version of the code issued by the Minister, which was pretty clear and unambiguous, as it should be. However, I was dismayed to read in the revised version of the draft code, published 10 days ago, that paragraph 3.1 has been changed. It now states:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/6\">\u201cThe admission authority must where necessary revise their admission arrangements as quickly as possible and no later than <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-04-15\">15 April</phrase> following the decisions (i.e. the deadline for determination of admission arrangements) to give effect to the Adjudicator\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/7\">It is not clear from reading out those two sentences, but there is an important difference in their visual presentation.

The proper sense of urgency and compulsion seems to have been replaced by one of contingency and delay. Although the second sentence states \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d, which is a weaker statement, the eye is drawn to \u201c<phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-04-15\">15 April</phrase>\u201d. Bearing in mind that the deadline for objections has been brought forward by a month to <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-06-30\">30 June</phrase>\u2014a sensible change that we support\u2014that means that there could be a delay of 10 months or more before a decision is implemented, which is simply unacceptable.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/9\">It is not necessarily for the legislation or the new code to undermine the effectiveness of the office of the adjudicator in a wholly unnecessary attempt to provide for circumstances that have not proved problematic under previous arrangements, so our amendment would put it beyond doubt that, where changes are required in response to valid objections, they must be implemented in time to benefit those who made them.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/10\">On constituting governing bodies, to which the Minister referred, it might be helpful if he offered some clarification. Our amendment was intended to make it absolutely clear what the Government\u2019s amendments mean in relation to staff on governing bodies. In Committee, the Minister said:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/11\">\u201cI am cautious about prescribing centrally the basis on which governing bodies should appoint people.\u201d<i>\u2013\u2013</i>[<i>Official Report, Education Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-03-31\">31 March 2011</phrase>; c. 811.]</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.599.1/12\">Having had time to consider the matter, the Government and the Minister appear to have changed their minds completely.

The whole point about admissions is fairness and how we can have a system that gives children fair access to local schools in accordance with their parents\u2019 wishes. In the centrally managed schools system that the Government are creating, it is regrettable that the Government have resisted placing a clear and unequivocal duty on the Secretary of State to work towards fair access to education.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.597.1/5\">We welcome the reinstatement of the duty on local authorities to send reports to the adjudicator, which is the effect of amendments 21 and 22.

I trust that that is what will happen.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.597.1/6\">A greater problem is the evidence that the reports contain about local authority action to ensure that admission arrangements are compliant with the law and the admissions code. The chief adjudicator himself has been lukewarm about the quality of such local authority reports, indicating that local authorities have been happy to confirm that admissions arrangements are code-compliant when, after investigation by the adjudicator, that has been found not to be the case. He noted in his recent annual report:</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.597.1/7\">\u201cIf LAs are truly going to focus on being the champions of children and parents, then they really must put more effort into their \u2018policing\u2019 role.\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.597.1/8\">The amendments, which collectively allow anybody to refer admissions arrangements to the adjudicator, are welcome, although that will be subject to regulations.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.597.1/9\">There is one area where we believe we can improve on the Lords amendments, in particular amendment 23 and new subsection (7) on objections to admissions arrangements.

It does not state the time in which the admissions arrangements must be made compliant.

These duties are examples of the latter.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.596.1/3\">As I said in an intervention, in Committee the Minister characterised the duty to co-operate as an unnecessary prescription and went on to say that it was not appropriate to delay the removal of that burden on schools.

The first is that in future each service, including education, must greatly fulfil its particular responsibilities to promote the safety and well-being of each child. The second is that each service must develop the skills to work successfully across organisational boundaries and share information at an early stage.\u201d\u2014[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2011-06-30\">30 June 2011</phrase>; Vol. 728, c.

By including these clauses, they originally showed their disdain for the services and processes that have since been put in place to keep our children safe. It is abhorrent that any Government, not least one who said at one time that they wanted to be the most family friendly ever, should be willing to risk the safety of our vulnerable children just so that they can reduce prescription.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.596.1/9\">I am glad that the Government have got it, albeit late in the day, but I am concerned that this is a temporary change of mind.

They persuaded the Government\u2014more effectively than my hon. Friends and I in the Commons did\u2014to change their mind on one or two issues, which I shall come to in a moment.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/2\">The Minister has taken the trouble to talk us through the Lords amendments, as he said he would, but some questions emerge from what he said that, if he has the leave of the House to speak later in the debate, I hope he will answer. Lords amendments 1 to 4 relate to clause 8 and the Secretary of State\u2019s functions in relation to teachers. The Bill abolishes the General Teaching Council for England. I note that some criticisms have been made of its operations. One year after the publication of the White Paper, \u201cThe Importance of Teaching\u201d, in which the Secretary of State said\u2014I agree with him about this\u2014that there was</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/3\">\u201cno calling more noble, no profession more vital and no service more important than teaching,\u201d</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/4\">it is significant that he has taken the opportunity to abolish the professional body.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/5\">The Bill transfers some of the General Teaching Council\u2019s functions to the Secretary of State, among which is the power to prohibit a teacher from teaching. In Committee in this House, we debated an Opposition amendment\u2014which, surprisingly, was not successful\u2014that would have required the Secretary of State to keep a list of persons prohibited from teaching. I note that Lord Hill confirmed in the other place that the Government believe that a database of teachers prohibited from teaching will be established. We tabled amendments here and in the other place to require the Secretary of State to keep a register of qualified teachers\u2014again, to our surprise, without success\u2014but Lord Hill indicated that he would consider the matter, saying,</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/6\">\u201cwe have been persuaded by concerns raised in this House and elsewhere that there is a genuine need for the Government to help schools to know who has qualified teacher status and who has passed induction.\u201d\u2014[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\"lords/2011-10-18.257\"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 18 October 2011; Vol. 731, c. 257</phrase>.]</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/7\">That is welcome. He went on to confirm that there would be an online database from 2012.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/8\">Another concern is the proposal to give employers discretion over which cases of misconduct\u2014those that might lead to the prohibition of a teacher\u2014to refer to the Secretary of State. Again, colleagues in both Houses raised concerns about transparency and consistency. I welcome Lord Hill\u2019s notification to Baroness Jones that the Government are developing advice on the new system to help professional conduct hearing panels determine when a teacher should be prohibited from the profession and that such advice will be available publicly.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/9\">Lords amendments 1 to 4 would enable the Secretary of State to issue interim prohibition orders\u2014quickly imposed orders that prevent a teacher from undertaking</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/10\">work while the Secretary of State is considering their case\u2014where he considers it in the public interest to do so, and they must be reviewed every six months. The amendments were tabled in Grand Committee in the House of Lords, but I do not think they were debated there. Their rationale was not given, so when the Minister replies he might like to emphasise what the rationale was, what the amendments will achieve, why they are so important and perhaps why they were not included in the first draft.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/11\">Lords amendments 5 to 15 relate to restrictions on the reporting of alleged offences by teachers, about which we had an exchange earlier. We have supported the Government\u2019s intention to help protect teachers from malicious allegations, but we have also been keen to ensure that the provisions are properly scrutinised, as there is a possibility of unintended consequences.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/12\">The Lords amendments would extend the reach of clause 13 to cover tentative allegations against teachers. As the Minister rightly pointed out, following advice from the trade unions and others, we argued that the clause\u2019s reach could be extended so that the restrictions apply not only to teachers in schools but to other school staff. The Chair of the Select Committee, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076\" name=\"Graham Stuart\">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase>\u2014I am sure it is only a matter of time before he becomes a right hon. Gentleman\u2014mentioned this earlier. In our view, other school staff and staff in further education colleges should be included. The impact of a publicly reported unproven allegation, which the Minister eloquently described, applies to those people, too, and is potentially equally damaging. I understand the Government\u2019s general desire to limit the number of people on whom the provisions will have an impact, but I do not understand why teachers in FE colleges should not be covered when teachers dealing with young people of the same age group in sixth forms\u2014quite possibly teaching exactly the same subjects\u2014are covered. This seems to be an inconsistency in the Bill.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.593.1/13\">I note what the Minister said about extending the provisions to cover tentative allegations. I make it clear that we do not object to that, but we ask him to be absolutely clear about his motives for including the amendments at this stage. Does he have any further thoughts on the desirability of extending the scope to include non-teaching staff and all staff in FE colleges? If he has any compelling reasons why those staff should be excluded, we would like to hear them. Having listened to him earlier, I am not sure what his evidence is for excluding these staff from the scope of the provisions. I understand why he might want to limit the number of people covered\u2014perhaps that is why he has put a ring fence around teachers\u2014but I do not understand the rationale for failing to include the other staff.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Kevin Brennan", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148", "column": "", "time": "016:15:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.593.1", "house": "commons"}

Co-operation is important, whether it is with children\u2019s trust boards or from local authorities with other elements of the education world, such as free schools and academies. Local authorities that undermine or try to undermine the establishment of new schools that are demanded by parents in that local authority will find their opinions and actions challenged at election time. For a school to be approved by the Secretary of State as a new free school, it has to demonstrate parental demand. It is not in the interests of a local authority not to co-operate when a group of parents, a group of teachers or others are seeking to establish a free school in its area.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.587.0/2\">I know that Labour Members wish to raise a particular concern about admissions, but I thought that it would be useful at this stage for me to explain changes made in the other place. Since we last met, the consultation on the revised admissions codes has closed. The new codes keep protections for those with special educational needs and vulnerable groups. We have expanded on this for children who were in public care\u2014looked after\u2014and have since been adopted. When they are adopted, they will retain their priority status in the admissions arrangements. We are also going to make things simpler for all parents by having a national offer day for primary schools.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.587.0/3\">The changes we are making on admissions are modest, and the changes made in the other place have been correspondingly so. First, under amendments 21 and 22, local authorities\u2019 annual reports will continue to go to the schools adjudicator in addition to being published locally. Secondly, under amendment 23, a new clause will allow anyone\u2014absolutely anyone\u2014to object to the adjudicator about school admission arrangements. This builds on our decision to bring complaints about admission arrangements at academies and free schools into the remit of the schools adjudicator\u2014a popular move in this House when we last discussed it. My noble Friend Lord Hill made a further commitment that will be of interest to this House. In Committee, the hon. Member for Cardiff West expressed concern about the possible side effects on the admissions system of an increase in the number of academies, which set their own admission arrangements. Lord Hill has now made a commitment that the chief schools adjudicator will include consideration of this issue in her next annual report.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.587.0/4\">The provisions in clause 37 seek to give maintained school governing bodies greater freedom to appoint governors on the basis of their skills.

It received detailed scrutiny here in the spring, in the course of 22 Committee sittings, before it went off to the other place. Their lordships have given it the full benefit of their diligence and expertise and I am pleased to say that its core content is as it was when it left this House. Before I address the amendments, it might be helpful if I briefly remind the House of the core content. Its main purpose is to give legislative effect to the proposals in the education White Paper, \u201cThe Importance of Teaching\u201d, published last November. It also contains some measures from the Department for Business Innovations and Skills, which my hon. Friend the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning will discuss in due course.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/2\">The Bill has four main themes. First, it seeks to give teachers and head teachers greater freedom and flexibility to use their judgment and expertise to get the best results for their pupils. International evidence shows that greater school autonomy characterises the best performing education systems. The Bill seeks to remove unnecessary legislative duties from schools and extends the benefits of the academies programme to 16 to 19-year-old pupils and vulnerable pupils in need of alternative provision.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/3\">Secondly, the Bill seeks to strengthen the powers and authority of teachers in relation to classroom discipline. We want all children to be educated in a safe environment that is free from disruption and we want all teachers and prospective teachers to feel confident that they have society\u2019s backing in tackling poor behaviour. The Bill will allow same-day after-school detentions and will provide a power to search pupils for any item likely to cause harm or injury. It will also give teachers pre-charge anonymity when faced with an allegation by a pupil that they have committed an offence.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/4\">Thirdly, the Bill matches the increased autonomy it seeks to introduce with sharpened accountability and seeks to focus Ofsted inspections on the four most important aspects of a school\u2019s work. It will require Ofqual, the independent regulator, to secure that the standards of English qualifications are comparable with the best in the world, and it will strengthen the powers of the Secretary of State to intervene in poorly performing schools. It will abolish five arm\u2019s length bodies to reduce wasteful duplication and will ensure that there is accountability to Parliament, through the Secretary of State, for functions that need to be carried out nationally.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/5\">Fourthly, the Bill seeks to promote greater fairness in the context of current fiscal constraints. It will give disadvantaged two-year-olds an entitlement to free early-years provision, and for new higher education students it will enable the new student finance arrangements to come into force.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/6\">There have been a relatively small number of technical and drafting amendments, but their Lordships have also made a number of substantive amendments to improve the Bill, and I shall now explain them.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/7\">The first four of the amendments made in the other place were all made at the request of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The Bill gives the Secretary of State a new power to make interim prohibition orders. That power was always intended for use in the very rare cases where it is in the public interest to bar an individual from teaching while investigation into their conduct is under way, prior to a final decision. Lords amendments 1 to 4 insert into the Bill the planned safeguards for the use of this power. Therefore, regulations would require the Secretary of State to make an interim prohibition order only where he or she considers it necessary in the public interest to do so. The regulations would also require the Secretary of State to review the order every six months if the teacher concerned applies for such a review.</p>\n\t", "<p pid=\"a.582.6/8\">The teacher anonymity provisions in clause 13 are important and sensitive measures. They give teachers protection against the damage to their lives and careers that can result from pre-charge publicity about allegations made by pupils against them. They are one part of the Government\u2019s proposals to back teachers\u2019 authority in the classroom.</p>\n"], "speakername": "Nick Gibb", "speakerid": "uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097", "column": "", "time": "015:41:00", "date": {"$date": 1321228800000}, "_id": "uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-14a.582.6", "house": "commons"}
